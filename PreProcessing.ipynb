We can call the Agronomy as backbone of all\\nagricultural sciences, because the management of soil and water, with a view to achieving the produc-\\ntion potential of high yielding varieties, in green revolution, is exclusively an agronomic domain. It may\\nnot be appear as glamorous as nuclear science or atomic ener gy working miracles but like Ayurvedic\\nmedicines, it has the capacity to reach the poorer section of the society to bring out the desired results.\\nAgronomists can be able to synthesise production practices from several fields of specialization.\\nThe problem of global food security remains unsolv ed. The increase in population means a grow-\\ning demand for food in the world, whereas the essential factors in food production such as cultivated\\nland and fresh water are decreasing continuously. Current trends on world agriculture shows that it is\\nimperative to find a scientific and rational way to develop it, a way that can not only steadily increase\\nthe output but also ensure long term sustainable use of re sources in the process of promoting agricul-\\ntural development. At present, there are many comprehensive text books on Agronomy available but\\nthis is the book from which one can have at least overview of all aspects of Agronomy.\\nIt is clear that young students are suffering from cultural shocks to shift from their environment.\\nSemester system of education of B.Sc.(Ag.), B.Sc.(Horti.), B.Sc.(Home Science), B.Sc.(Forestry) and\\nB.Tech.(Ag.

There is a need to use simple language. The present book titled “A Text book of\\nAgronomy” suite to the need of students. I am happy that the authors have made painful efforts to\\nwrite this agronomy book. It covers a wide range of topics. In this connection, publication of the book\\n“A Textbook of Agronomy” by Dr. B. Chandrasekaran, Dr. K. Annadurai and Dr. E. Somasundaram\\nof TNAU, Coimbatore is quite appropriate and timely.\\nI expect that both the students and teachers would benefit immensely from the book contents. In\\nparticular, I expect that this book containing 17 chapters covering comprehensively the content of\\nall courses in Agronomy for undergraduate students of B.Sc. (Ag.), B.Tech (Agr l. Engg/FPE/EEE.),\\nB.Sc.(Forestry), B.Sc.(Home Science) and B.Sc.(Horticulture) will be a valuable reference.\\nThe authors deserve commendation for their painful efforts and my congratulations to them.

Food production has to be increased to 240 m.t. within the next five years. To achieve the\\nmassive target, very little scope and possibility exist in respect of horizontal expansion.

Hence, agriculture is the most important enterprise in the world. It is\\na productive unit where the free gifts of nature namel y land, light, air, temperature and rain water etc.,\\nare integrated into single primary unit indispensable for human beings. Secondary productive units\\nnamely animals including livestock, birds and insects, feed on these primary units and provide concen-\\ntrated products such as meat, milk, wool, eggs, honey, silk and lac.\\nAgriculture provides food, feed, fibre, fuel, furniture, ra w materials and materials for and from\\nfactories; provides a free fare and fresh environment, abundant food for driving out famine; favours\\nfriendship by eliminating fights. Satisfactory agricultural production brings peace, prosperity, harmony,\\nhealth and wealth to individuals of a nation by driving away distrust, discord and anarchy. It helps to\\nelevate the community consisting of different castes and clauses, thus it leads to a better social, cultural,\\npolitical and economical life. Agricultural development is multidirectional having galloping speed and\\nrapid spread with respect to time and space. After green revolution, farmers started using improved\\ncultural practices and agricultural inputs in intensive cropping systems with labourer intensive pro-\\ngrammes to enhance the production potential per unit land, time and input. It provided suitable envi-\\nronment to all these improved genotypes to foster and manifest their yield potential in newer areas and\\nseasons. Agriculture consists of growing plants and rearing animals in order to yield, produce and thus\\nit helps to maintain a biological equilibrium in nature.\\n1.0 AN INTRODUCTION TO AGRICULTURE\\nA.  Terminology\\nAgriculture is derived from Latin words Ager and Cultura. Ager means land or field and Cultura means\\ncultivation. Therefore the term agriculture means cultivation of land. i.e., the science and art of produc-\\ning crops and livestock for economic purposes. It is also referred as the science of producing crops and\\nlivestock from the natural resources of the earth. The primary aim of agriculture is to cause the land to\\nproduce more abundantly, and at the same time, to protect it from deterioration and misuse. It is\\nsynonymous with farming–the production of food, fodder and other industrial materials.\\nB.  Definitions\\nAgriculture is defined in the Agriculture A ct 1947, as including ‘horticulture, fruit growing, seed\\ngrowing, dairy farming and livestock breeding and keeping, the use of land as grazing land, meadow'),\n",

It is also defined as ‘purposeful work\\nthrough which elements in nature are harnessed to produce plants and animals to meet the human\\nneeds. It is a biological production process, which depends on the growth and development of selected\\nplants and animals within the local environment.\\nC.  Agriculture as art, science and business of crop production\\nAgriculture is defined as the art, the science and the business of producing crops and the livestock for\\neconomic purposes.\\nAs an art,  it embraces knowledge of the way to perform the operations of the farm in a skillful\\nmanner. The skill is categorized as;\\nPhysical skill: It involves the ability and capacity to carry out the operation in an efficient way for\\ne.g., handling of farm implements, animals etc.,  sowing of seeds, fertilizer and pesticides application\\netc.\\nMental skill: The farmer is able to take a decision based on experience, such as (i) time and method\\nof ploughing, (ii) selection of crop and cropping system to suit soil and climate, (iii) adopting improved\\nfarm practices etc.\\nAs a science :  It utilizes all modern technologies de veloped on scientific principles such as crop\\nimprovement/breeding, crop production, crop protection, economics etc., to maximize the yield and\\nprofit. For example, new crops and varieties developed by hybridization, transgenic crop varieties\\nresistant to pests and diseases, hybrids in each crop, high fertilizer responsive varieties, water manage-\\nment, herbicides to control weeds, use of bio-control agents to combat pest and diseases etc.\\nAs the business :  As long as agriculture is the way of life of the rural population, production is\\nultimately bound to consumption. But agriculture as a business aims at maximum net return through the\\nmanagement of land, labour, water and capital, employing the knowledge of various sciences for\\nproduction of food, feed, fibre and fuel. In recent years, agriculture is commercialized to run as a\\nbusiness through mechanization.\\n1.1 SCOPE OF AGRICULTURE IN INDIA\\nIn India, population pressure is increasing while area under cultivation is static (as shown in the land\\nutilization statistics given below) or even shrinking, which demand intensification of cropping and\\nallied activities in two dimensions i.e., time and space dimension. India is endowed with tropical\\nclimate with abundant solar energy throughout the year, which favours growing crops round the year.\\nThere is a vast scope to increase irrigation potential by river projects and minor irrigation projects. In\\nadditional to the above, India is blessed with more labourer availability. Since agriculture is the primary\\nsector, other sectors are dependent on agriculture.\\nTotal geographical area : 328.848 million ha.\\nTotal reporting area : 304.300 million ha.\\nArea under cultivation : 143.000 million ha.\\nTotal cropped area : 179.750 million ha.\\nArea sown more than once : 36.750 million ha.\\nArea not available for cultivation : 161.300 million ha.\\nArea under forest : 66.400 million ha.'),\n",

In 8th five-year plan,\\nnearly 23% of the national budget allocation goes to agriculture and allied agro-based cottage industries\\nrun on small scales. More than 60% of the Indian population (60 millions/1.05 billion) depends or\\ninvolved in agriculture and allied activities. Nearly 40% of the net national product is from agricultural\\nsector. Approximately 35% employment is generated from agriculture, out of which 75% is found in\\nrural areas either directly or indirectly.\\nIn India, food grain production increased almost four folds from about 50 million tones at inde-\\npendence to more than 220 million tones in 2005 through green revolution. Despite variation in the\\nperformance of individual crops and regions, total food grain production maintained a growth of 2.7%\\nper annum, which kept ahead of population growth at about 2.2% per annum. Through white revolu-\\ntion, milk production increased from 17 million tones at independence to 69 million tones (1997–98).\\nThrough blue revolution,  fish production rose from 0.75 million tones to nearly 5.0 million tones\\nduring the last five decades.

By following the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff (GATT) and the liberaliza-\\ntion process, globalization of markets would call for competitiveness and efficiency of agricultural\\nproduction. Agriculture will face challenging situations on the ecological, global climate, economic\\nequity, energy and employment fronts in the years to come.\\n1.2 BRANCHES OF AGRICULTURE\\nAgriculture has 3 main spheres viz., Geoponic (Cultivation in earth-soil), Aeroponic (cultivation in air)\\nand Hydroponic (cultivation in water). Agricultur e is the branch of science encompassing the applied\\naspects of basic sciences. The applied aspects of agricultural science consists of study of field crops and\\ntheir management (Arviculture) including soil management.\\nCrop production - It deals with the production of various crops, which includes food crops, fodder\\ncrops, fibre crops, sugar, oil seeds, etc. It includes agronomy, soil science, entomology, pathology,\\nmicrobiology, etc. The aim is to have better food production and how to control the diseases.\\nHorticulture - Branch of agriculture deals with the production of flowers, fruits, vegetables,\\nornamental plants, spices, condiments (includes narcotic crops-opium, etc., which has medicinal value)\\nand beverages.\\nAgricultural Engineering - It is an important component for crop production and horticulture\\nparticularly to provide tools and implements. It is aiming to produce modified tools to facilitate proper\\nanimal husbandry and crop production tools, implements and machinery in animal production.\\nForestry - It deals with production of large scale cultivation of perennial trees for supplying wood,\\ntimber, rubber, etc. and also raw materials for industries.\\nAnimal Husbandry - The animals being produced, maintained, etc. Maintenance of various types\\nof livestock for direct energy (work energy). Husbandry is common for both crop and animals. The\\nobjective is to get maximum output by feeding, rearing, etc. The arrangement of crops is done to get'),\n",

To this day, some groups still pursue this\\nsimple way of life and others have continued as roving herdsmen. However, as various groups of men\\nundertook deliberate cultivation of wild plants and domestication of wild animals, agriculture came into\\nbeing. Cultivation of crops, notably grains such as wheat, rice, barley and millets, encouraged settle-\\nment of stable farm communities, some of which grew into a town or city in various parts of the world.\\nEarly agricultural implements-digging stick, hoe, scythe and plough-developed slowly over the centu-\\nries and each innovation caused profound changes in human life. From early times too, men created\\nindigenous systems of irrigation especially in semi-arid areas and regions of periodic rainfall.\\nFarming was intimately associated with landholding and therefore with political organization.\\nGrowth of large estates involved the use of slaves and bound or semi-free labourers. As the Middle Ages\\nwanted increasing communications, the commercial revolution and the steady rise of cities in Western\\nEurope tended to turn agriculture away from subsistence farming towards the growing of crops for sale'),\n",

Exploration and intercontinental trade\\nas well as scientific investigations led to the development of agricultural knowledge of various crops\\nand the exchange of mechanical devices such as the sugar mill and Eli Whitney’s cotton gin helped to\\nsupport the system of large plantations based on a single crop.\\nThe industrial revolution, after the late 18th century, swelled the population of towns and cities and\\nincreasingly forced agriculture into greater integration with general economic and financial patterns.\\nThe era of mechanized agriculture began with the invention of such farm machines as the reaper,\\ncultivator, thresher, combine harvesters and tractors, which continued to appear over; the years leading\\nto a new type of large scale agriculture. Modern science has also revolutionized food processing.\\nBreeding programmes have developed highly specialized animal, plant and poultry varieties thus\\nincreasing production efficiency greatly. All over the world, agricultural colleges and government agen-\\ncies attempt to increase output by disseminating knowledge of improved agricultural practices through\\nthe release of new plant and animal types and by continuous intensive research into basic and applied\\nscientific principles relating to agricultural production and economics.\\n1.3.1 History of Agriculture\\nExcavations, legends and re mote sensing tests reveal that agriculture is 10,000 years old. Women by\\ntheir intrinsic insight first observed that plants come up from seeds. Men concentrated on hunting and\\ngathering (Paleolithic and Neolithic periods) during that time. Women were the pioneers for cultivating\\nuseful plants from the wild flora. They dug out edible roots and rhizomes and buried the small ones for\\nsubsequent harvests. They used animal meat as main food and their skin for clothing. The following\\nTable 1.1 gives an idea about agriculture development scenario.\\nTable 1.1.

Shifting Cultivation\\nA primitive form of agriculture in which people working with the crudest of tools, cut down a part of\\nthe forest, burnt the underneath growth and started new garden sites. After few years, when these plots\\nlost their fertility or became heavily infested with weeds or soil-borne pests, they shifted to a new site.\\nThis is also known as Assartage system (cultivating crops till the land is completely worn-out) contrary\\nto the fallow system. Fallow system means land is allowed for a resting period without any crop. In\\nIndia, shifting cultivation existed in different states, with different names as jhum cultivation in Assam,\\npodu in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa, kumari in Western Ghats, walra in south east Rajasthan, penda\\nbewar in Madhya Pradesh and slash and burn in Bihar.'),\n",

Subsistence Farming\\nAdvanced form of primitive agriculture i.e., agriculture is considered as a way of life based on the\\nprinciple of “Grow it and eat it” instead of growing crops on a commercial basis. Hence, it is referred\\nas raising the crops only for family needs.\\nD.  Mixed Farming\\nIt is the farming comprising of crop and animal components.

Scientific Agriculture (19th Century)\\nDuring 18th century, modern agriculture was started with crop sequence, organic recycling, introduc-\\ntion of exotic crops and animals, use of farm implements in agriculture etc. During 19th century,\\nresearch and development (R&D) in fundamental and basic sciences were brought under applied\\naspects of agriculture. Agriculture took the shape of a teaching science. Laboratories, farms, research\\nstations, research centres, institutes for research, teaching and extension (training and demonstration)\\nwere developed. Books, journals, popular and scientific articles, literatures were introduced. New media,\\nand audio-visual aids were developed to disseminate new research findings and information to the rural\\nmasses.\\nG.  Present Day Agriculture (21st Century)\\nToday agriculture is not merely production oriented but is becoming a business consisting of various\\nenterprises like livestock (dairy), poultry, fishery, piggery, sericulture, apiary, plantation cropping etc.\\nNow, a lot of developments on hydrological,  mechanical, chemical, genetical and technological\\naspects of agriculture are in progress. Governments are apportioning a greater share of national budget\\nfor agricultural development. Small and marginal farmers are being supplied with agricultural inputs on\\nsubsidy. Policies for preserving, processing, pricing, marketing, distributing, consuming, exporting and\\nimporting are strengthening. Agro-based small scale industries and crafts are fast developing. Need\\nbased agricultural planning, programming and execution are in progress.\\n1.3.2 Global Agriculture\\nAdvancement of civilization is closely r elated to agriculture, which pr oduces food to satisfy hunger.\\nThe present food production must double to maintain the status quo. However, nearly one billion people\\nare living below poverty line and ci vilized society should ensure food for these people. Some allowance\\nshould be made for increased consumption as a consequence of raising incomes in third would countries.\\nTherefore, the increased food production should aim at trebling food production in the next century.'),\n",

India has the largest SAT area (10%) of any of the developing countries.\\nEnvironmental degradation is increasing at a pace that is impairing the productivity of land and\\nundermining the welfare of rural people. Global assessment of soil degradation (GLASoD) defines soil\\ndegradation as a process tha t describes human induced phenomena, whic h lower the current and/or\\nfuture capacity of the soil to support human life.  The causes for degradation are:\\n\\x7f Removal of vegetative cov er through agr icultural clearing,\\n\\x7f Decrease in soil cover through removal of vegetation for fuel wood, fencing, etc.\\n\\x7f Overgrazing by livestock leading to decrease in vegetative cover and trampling of the soil\\n\\x7f Agricultural activities like cultivation in steep slopes, farming without anti-erosion measures in\\narid areas, improper irrigation and use of heavy machinery, and\\n\\x7f Soil contamination with pollutants such as waste discharges and over use of agrochemicals.\\nModern farm technologies are more productive on good soils than on poor soils. Technology may\\nsustain yields by making the effects of soil degradation temporarily. Yield increase through technology\\nmight have been greater if the soil has not been degraded.\\nB. Water Resources\\nOf the total volume of 1400 million cubic km (M cu km) water, 97 per cent is sea water. Of the balance\\n3 per cent, 22 per cent is ground water and 77 per cent locked up glaciers and polar ice caps, leaving\\nless than one per cent of fresh water to take part in hydrological cycle. Global water use doubled\\nbetween 1940 and 1980 and is expected to double again by 2010 A.D. with two-thirds of the projected\\nwater use going to agriculture. Today one-third of the world’s crops come from its 280 M ha of irrigated\\nland. After world war II, foreign aid helped carry  irrigation even to arid corners of the world. As on\\n1990, about 270 M ha of area, contributing to 17 per cent of the total cropped area, was under irrigation\\nin the world. Today, irrigated farming systems of the past are under serious threat of extinct due to\\nsalinity, poor drainage and weak management. Irrigated land damaged through salinisation fro the top\\nfive countries, as percentage of total area irrigated by 1985 are: India 36, China 17, USSR 18, USA 44\\nand Pakistan 25. Irrigated area per capita for India (1989) is 0.057 ha as against 0.049 ha for the world.\\nIn rainfed agriculture, the cropping intensity of world is 0.74. Under irrigation, the current intensity of\\n1.21 may increase to 1.29. To maintain a diet of 2000 Cal day-1 requires 300 m 3 of water per day and\\n420 for a diet of 3500 Cal. Bringing one ha of new land under cultivation will produce 0.9 tonnes of\\ncereal grain, one year supply of food for about five people at FAO minimum nutritional standard of\\n1600 Cal day-1. If the land is irrigated, the total production increases four folds to 3.5 tonnes ha -1. At\\nthis level, if future irrigated area of the world reaches 1.0 billion ha, enough food for 10 billion people\\nat twice the FAO level.\\nIn spite of the fact that irrigation can provide food for ever increasing population, experience in the\\nrecent decades in expansion of irrigated area ran into several problems leading to land degradation. Year\\nto year changes in world irrigated area reflect the sum of the addition of the new capacity and loss of\\nestablished capacity due to aquifer depletion, lowered water tables, abandonment of waterlogged area\\nand salted land, reservoir silting and diversion of irrigation water to non-agricultural use. The future\\nfood production from irrigated areas depends more on the gains in water use efficiency than on addi-\\ntional new supplies.\\nC.

Compared with present production of about 1.9 billion tones, the demand for cereals is likely to\\ngo up to 2.4 billions by the year 2000 A.D. While demand for wheat and rice may be increased in the\\nnext two decades by 31 and 53 per cent, respectively, the demand for coarse grains may double.\\nDeveloped nations may meet their cereal demand by increasing production at 1.8 per cent per annum.\\nHowever, most of the developing countries with growth rate of 2.5 per cent per annum in cereals\\nproduction fall short of this requirement, which is increasing at the rate of 3.3 per cent per annum due\\nto high population growth rate. The FAO estimates clearly indicate the increasing shortage of cereals\\nin 90 developing countries.\\nIncrease in food all over world during the decades of 1972–92 was remarkable. Productivity and\\nproduction in the technologically advanced agriculture of the developed countries rose to heights that\\nwould have been unbelievable half a century ago, mainly due to introduction of high yielding varieties\\n(HYVs) responsive to inputs of fertilities and irrigation water, besides increase in area under cultivations.\\nDeveloping countries presented a different picture. Only about a third of their population (excluding\\nChina) lived in countries with satisfactory performance in agricultural production. Elsewhere, output\\nwas raising more slowly than population.

The hopeful outcome depends on achieving an ambitions transformation involving wide-\\nspread modernization in technology, based primarily on massive increase in inputs to agriculture.\\nDeveloped countries do not come directly into the exploration of the future as they continue to raise\\ntheir farming. The strategy is:\\n\\x7f Heavy investment in agricultural sector to make full use of the improved technology.\\n\\x7f Increasing crop production sources through arable land growth, cropping intensity and crop\\nproductivity.\\n\\x7f Expanding and conserving the land, based through land reforms directed at bringing underused\\nland in to more intensive exploration and soil and water conservation to the dangers of land\\ndegradation, and\\n\\x7f Intensifying land use in crop production through irriga tion, fertilizers, improved cultivates, plant\\nprotection and mechanization.\\nD.

The present role of agriculture in the\\nIndian economy is discussed below.\\nA. Contribution to National Income\\nThe data supplied by the National Income Committee and the Central Statistical Organization clearly\\nshows that agriculture contributed about 56 per cent of the national income in 1950–51 but contributed\\nonly 22 per cent of the national income in 2006–07. The perusal of data in Table 1.3 reveals that the\\nshare of agriculture in the national income was reckoned at about 56 per cent during 1950–51 and\\nremained above 50 per cent during the following twenty years. However, the contribution of agriculture\\nhas declined in the last fifteen years due to rapid increase in the production of industrial goods and\\nservices.\\nTable 1.3. Contribution of Agriculture to National Income\\nYear Percentage contribution of agriculture–GDP\\n1950-51 56.1\\n1960-61 51.2\\n1970-71 50.6\\n1980-81 42.0\\n1984-85 36.9\\n1989-90 30.0\\n1999-2000 24.0\\n2000-01 22.3\\n2001-02 22.2\\n2002-03 20.2\\n2003-04 20.7\\n2004-05 NA\\n2005-06 NA\\n2006-07  22.0\\nA comparison between shares of agriculture in national income in India with that in other countries\\nfurther emphasizes dominance of agriculture in the Indian economy. In 1983, agriculture contributed\\nonly two, three, four and five per cent of the national income in U.K., U.S.A., Canada and Australia\\nrespectively. It means the more developed a country, the smaller is the share of agriculture in the\\nnational income or output. Hence, the Indian economy cannot be considered as advanced.\\nB. Contribution to Employment\\nAgriculture, directly or indirectly, has continued to be the main source of livelihood for the majority of\\nthe population in India. The decennial censuses indicate that 70 per cent of the population is supported\\nby agriculture. These censuses show that an overwhelming majority of workers have been engaged in\\ncultivation. Dependence of working population on other fields of agriculture like livestock, fisheries,\\nforest etc., is less.  The distribution of agricultural labourer force and population is given in Table 1.4.\\nOn the basis of above figures, it can be concluded that:\\n\\x7f The rate and pattern of investment in other economic sectors have not been such as to draw away\\nsurplus rural labourer and relieve the pressure of population on land.'),\n",

It is\\nonly two and three per cent in the U.K. and the U.S.A., 6 per cent in Australia and 7 per cent in France.\\nIn backward and underdeveloped countries the pr oportion of working population engaged in agricul-\\nture is quite high. For instance, it is 42 per cent in Egypt, 52 per cent in Indonesia and 72 per cent in\\nChina.\\nC. Contribution of Manpower to industry\\nThe agricultural labourer of rural sector has been the supplier of manpower to industry. The findings of\\nthe Commission on Labourer are indicative that the Indian factory operatives were nearly all migrants\\nfrom the rural areas. This drift to urban areas continues. This is due to lack of opportunities for\\nemployment and income in rural areas on the one hand and lure of employment, higher income and\\nurban facilities on the other.\\nD. Contribution to Foreign Exchange Resources\\nAgricultural products–primary produce and manufactured through agricultural raw material occupy an\\nimportant place in the country’s export. According to an estimate, agricultural commodities like raw\\ncotton and jute, unmanufactured tobacco, oilseeds, spices, tea and coffee accounted for about 49 per\\ncent of the total value of exports in 1988–89. This makes a sizable contribution to the foreign exchange\\nresources of the country.\\nE. Interdependence between Agriculture and Industry\\nThere is a close interdependence between agriculture and industry. This is to the supply of raw\\nmaterials and inputs from agriculture to industry and vice-versa; secondly, the supply of wage goods to\\nthe industrial sector; thirdly, the supply of basic consumption goods to the agricultural population; and\\nfinally, the supply of materials for the building up of economic and social overheads in the agricultural\\nsector.

Agricultural inputs like fertilizers, pes-\\nticides, diesel oil, electric motor, diesel engines, pump sets, agricultural tools and implements, tractors,\\npower tillers etc., are supplied by the industry and oil, sugar, jute and cotton textiles and tobacco\\nindustries rely heavily on the agricultural sector. Even the processing industr ies, which are utilizing\\nagricultural raw material, and developing fruit canning, milk products,  meat products etc.\\nF. Contribution to Capital Formation\\nThe pace of development is largely determined by the rate at which production assets increase. Before\\nindependence, the capital formation in Indian agriculture was of a low order. During this period,\\nagriculture suffered from constant low yield technology, inequitable land tenure system and exploita-\\ntion of the rural masses. The capital formation includes land development, construction of houses etc.\\nSince independence, much more investment both public and private has been made in agriculture. The\\ncreation of physical assets has generally taken the form of land development, construction of irrigation\\nfacilities, roads and communication, farm buildings, agricultural machinery and equipment, warehouses,\\ncold storages, market yard etc. This capital formation is helping not only development of agriculture but\\nalso the entire economy.\\nG. Contribution to Purchasing Power of People\\nAgriculture provides purchasing power not only to those directly engaged in it but to others also who\\nare in the industries and services. When farmers earn more they also spend more. In the process, they\\ncreate new markets and new opportunities for hundreds of blac ksmiths, carpenters, masons, weavers,\\npotters, leather workers, utensil-makers, tailors, cotton ginners, oil presser s, transporters and countless\\nothers.\\nThus, there are many industries, the prosperity and employment of which are dependent upon the\\npurchasing power of the agricultural population. Hence, it is concluded that besides purchasing food for\\nnon-agricultural workers and raw materials for consumer industries, it has created demands for a great\\nmany new industries, which, in turn, have provided high and w ell paid employment. This existing role\\nof agriculture in the Indian economy points out the necessity for the development of Indian agriculture\\nto the fullest extent possible as the prosperity of agriculture largely stands for the prosperity of the\\neconomy. The significance of agriculture lies in the fact that the development in agriculture is an\\nessential condition for the development of the national economy.\\n1.5 FOOD PROBLEM IN INDIA\\nA. Food Production Trends\\nThe trends in food grains output in recent years have exhibited some significant qualitative changes. On\\nthe other hand, there was significant effect of drought on the food grains production during the year\\n1987–88 and 2002–2003.\\nRice production fluctuated around 60 million tones for five years and then followed the rising trend\\nfrom 1988–89. This was possible due to government’s efforts to increase the productivity of rice in the\\ncountry in general and in the eastern parts of the country in particular. What production had been\\nstaggering around 45 million tones for five year s before a quantum jump in 1988–89. But there was a\\nfall in wheat production during 1989–90,  which was attributed to shift of wheat area to oilseeds for\\ngetting better prices of the produce. The production of pulses has also been stagnant around 12–13\\nmillion tones except for a fall in the drought year i.e., 1987–88. The trends of coarse grains and kharif\\nfood grains are in the same line as of rice while rabi food grains followed the trend of wheat. Since the'),\n",

Food Problem\\nIndia’s food problem dates back prior to independence. In the beginning, India’s food problem was one\\nof scarcity, shortage of rice after the separation of Myanmar (Burma) from India in 1937 and shortage\\nof wheat, also after the partition of the country in 1947. Initially, the major concern of the Government\\nwas to increase the domestic supplies either through increased production or through imports or through\\nboth. In the second half of the 1950s and during the 1960s the major concern of the Government shifted\\nto control of food grains prices. The Government of India entered into an agreement in 1956 with the\\nUSA known as PL 480 agreement for the import of rice and wheat. The Government found the PL 480\\nfood imports a good tool to stabilize food prices in the country. In fact, PL 480 imports were the basis\\nof our agricultural and industrial development.\\nThe Government set up the Food grains Policy Committee in 1966 to review the food problem\\nafresh. The committee found India’s dependence on food imports was not likely to be easy in future.\\nIt took serious note of the fact that the food aid was used openly to influence the internal economic\\npolicies and foreign affairs policies of the Government. Between 1967–68 and 1989–90, Punjab, Haryana\\nand Uttar Pradesh had recorded annual growth rates of 5.4, 4.0 and 3.4 per cent, respectively in food\\ngrains production. These states are the backbone of our public distribution system. These states have'),\n",

In the 1970s and particularly after 1974, there has been\\na growing surplus of stocks from the original target of 5.0 million tones; the Government had succeeded\\nin accumulating over 30 million tones of buffer stock of food grains during the 1980s. Actually, it was\\nthe huge reserves of food grains which helped the Government to tide over successfully the three years\\nof poor food grains production, culminating in the widespread drought of 1987–88.\\nThe food problem is not any more one of shortage or of high prices but how to enable the lower\\nincome groups to purchase the available food grains and ho w to make use of the huge food stocks to\\nhelp accelerate the process of economic growth. The food for work programme has been designed since\\n1977–78 to provide work for the rural poor, the unemployed and the famine stricken people and at the\\nsame time create durable community assets. The Government is also implementing a scheme to provide\\nfood grains to the weaker sections, especially in the tribal areas at a price well below the already\\nsubsidized price in the public distribution system. There has been a general ag reement that the food\\nproblem in India is mainly due to the increasing population (consequently increasing food demand),\\ninadequate supply of food grains and some aspects of the Government’s policy on food.\\nC. Measures to Solve the Food Problem\\nIndia’s food problem is older than our independence but it is a pity that no permanent solution has been\\nfound all these years. The Government of India has taken various steps to solve the food problem,\\nwhich are discussed ahead.\\nD. Measures to Increase Production\\nTechnological changes :  Among the measures to increase the production of food grains, the least\\ncontroversial are technological changes. Intensive cultivation through use of improved varieties and the\\nliberal use of irrigation and fertilizers is being vigorously extended in the country ushering in the green\\nrevolution. The latest step is to bring about a break through in rainfed and dry land agriculture.\\nOrganizational approach : The second approach to agricultural development is the organizational\\napproach i.e., by adequate and efficient organization, which includes not only the governmental\\nadministrative system but the entire framework of official and semi-official institutions and agencies.\\nIt is opined that the efforts to increase agricultural production through technological changes have not\\nbeen very successful mainly because of an inadequate and ineffective organization. Institutional changes\\nthe other way to increase agricultural production is through bringing institutional changes i.e., through\\nland reforms. The present agrar ian structure is such that there ar e no incentives for increased produc-\\ntion. With tiny holdings, which are scattered all over the village, with a system of landholdings in which\\nthe tenant has no security of tenure, it is not wise to expect the tiller to put his best efforts to increase\\nfood production. The Government has been pursuing many land reform measures such as consolidation\\nof holdings, ceiling on holdings, regulation of tenures and the formation of cooperative farms. Since\\nthere are many loopholes in the regulation of land reforms, there is urgent need to plug these loopholes\\nthrough effective legislations on the part of the Government.\\nDistributional changes : In the last few years, the Government has expanded the public distribu-\\ntion system (PDS) considerably. From over two m illion tones in 1956, the public distribution system\\nhas handled over 19 million tones in 1987–88. In 1991, steps were taken to revamp the PDS and its\\nreach extended to 1700 blocks in far-flung and disadvantaged areas like economically backward, drought\\nprone, desert and hilly areas. Allocation of rice, wheat, etc., under the PDS should be increased for the\\nlean period. There is need of the hour to strengthen the public distribution system in the country.\\nStabilization of food grains prices : The main objective of the food policy in recent years has been\\nto hold the food grains prices in check. The Government has been adopting such short-term measures'),\n",

These measures did have some influence in\\nkeeping prices in check but past experience shows that price stability has not been fully achieved. The\\nbuffer stock operation by the Government is the key to the problem of sta bilization not only of food\\nprices but also of general price level in the country. The Government decided to build up a buffer stock\\nof 5 m.t. of food grains by 1973–74 but the actual stock with the Government from 1979 onwards has\\nbeen over 20 m.t. which is a good sign. It is opined that if it is managed with wisdom and flexibility,\\nit would go a long way to protect both the farmer and the consumer against severe fluctuations in prices.\\nThe existence of large food stocks creates a feeling of complacency that the food shortage is a thing of\\nthe past. There is every possibility of the output becoming larger with the expansion of irrigation\\nfacilities, fertilizers availability, rural electrification, etc. But it should be very clearly understood that\\nthe highly fluctuating monsoon and the consequent ups and downs in food output can always spell\\ndanger.

Literally, agronomy means the “art of managing field”. Techni-\\ncally, it means the “science and economics of crop production by management of farm land”.\\nDefinition : Agronomy is the art and underlying science in production and improvement of field\\ncrops with the efficient use of soil fertility, water, labourer and other factors related to crop production.\\nAgronomy is the field of study and practice of ways and means of production of food, feed and fibre\\ncrops. Agronomy is defined as “a branch of agricultural science which deals with principles and prac-\\ntices of field crop production and management of soil for higher productivity.\\nImportance : Among all the branches of agriculture, agronomy occupies a pivotal position and is\\nregarded as the mother branch or primary branch. Like agriculture, agronomy is an integrated and\\napplied aspect of different disciplines of pure sciences. Agronomy has three clear branches namely,\\n(i) Crop Science, (ii) Soil Science, and (iii) Environmental Science that deals only with applied aspects.\\n(i.e.,) Soil-Crop-Environmental relationship. Agronomy is a synthesis of several disciplines like crop\\nscience, which includes plant breeding, crop physiology and biochemistry etc., and soil science, which\\nincludes soil fertilizers, manures etc., and environmental science which includes meteorology and crop\\necology.\\nBasic Principles\\n\\x7f Planning, programming and executing measures for maximum utilization of land, labourer,\\ncapital and other factors of production.\\n\\x7f Choice of crop varieties adaptable to the particular agro-climate, land situation, soil fertility,\\nseason and method of cultivation and befitting to the cropping system;\\n\\x7f Proper field management by tillage, preparing field channels and bunds for irrigation and\\ndrainage, checking soil erosion, leveling and adopting other suitable land improvement practices;\\n\\x7f Adoption of multiple cropping and also mixed or intercropping to ensure harvest even under\\nadverse environmental conditions;\\n\\x7f Timely application of proper and balanced nutr ients to the crop and improvement of soil fertility\\nand productivity.

The Earth’s crust is broken into many pieces,\\nwhich are called plates. These plates are in constant motion causing earthquakes, mountain building,\\nvolcanism, the production of “new” crust and the destruction of “old” crust. There are three kinds of\\nplate boundaries:\\n1. Convergent boundary - Where two plates collide to form mountains or a subduction zone.\\n2. Divergent boundary - Where two plates are moving in opposite directions as in a mid-ocean\\nridge.\\n3. Transform boundary - Where two plates are sliding past each other as in the San Andreas fault\\nof California.\\nThe Earth’s plates are in constant, but very, very slow motion. They move at only 1/2–4 inches\\n(1.3–10 cm) per year!! This does not seem like much, but over millions of years it adds up to great\\ndistances of movement. In 1912, Alfred Wagener introduced the ‘Continental Drift Theory ’, which\\nstates that the continents have moved,  and is still moving today. Scientists believe these plates have\\nbeen moving for millions of years. In fact, 250 millions years ago the Earth’s seven continents were all\\ngrouped together into a super continent (one huge landmass) called ‘ Pangea’. This huge super conti-\\nnent was surrounded by one gigantic ocean called Panthalassa.\\nThe position of the continents of Antarctica was far north of its current position; Australia sipped\\nsideways and far west of its current position and the subcontinent of India was hundreds of miles from\\nAsia.

The\\nmovement is caused by the convection currents that roll over in the upper zone of the mantle. This\\nmovement in the mantle causes the plates to move slowly across the surface of the Earth. Pangea broke\\nup in four stages. In the first stage during the Triassic period a bout 200 million years ago, rifting\\noccurred between Laurasia and Gondwanaland. Laurasia was made of the present day continents of\\nNorth America (Greenland), Europe, Angara land comprising Russia, Siberia and China in the north.\\nGondwanaland was made of the present day continents of South America, Africa, India, Australia, and\\nAntarctica. Notice that at this time India was not connected to Asia. The huge ocean of Panthalassa\\nremained but the Atlantic Ocean was going to be born soon with the splitting of North Amer ica from\\nthe Eurasian Plate.\\n‘The Triple Junction’ was formed because of a three-way split in the crust allowing massive lava\\nflows in three directions and poured out lava over hundreds of square miles of Africa and South\\nAmerica. The rocks of the triple junction, which today is the west central portion of Africa and the east\\ncentral portion of Sout h America, are identical matches for age and mineral make up.

The land area of peninsular India\\nhas never been submerged under the sea. The western ghats form the western edge, and the eastern\\nghats the eastern edge of the plateau,  which slopes towards the east whereas the Himalayas and the\\nIndo-Gangetic plain are comparatively young. Marine sediment occurs at the roof of the Everest.\\nThe Cretaceous period began 110 million years ag o and lasted for 50 million y ears. During the\\nmiddle and the upper Cretaceous, the land areas especially in the Puducherry, Tiruchirappalli sector, are\\nmainly littoral. The fauna of this sector is similar to that of Malagasy (Madagascar) and South Africa\\nand to that of the southern flank of the Assam range. Along the Narmada V alley on the west coast are\\nsome marine fossil ferrous beds with fossils showing greater affinity with those of the Cretaceous of\\nsouthern Arabia and Europe than with those of Assam and Tiruchirappalli regions.

Below the Himalayas is the Siwalik Hills, extending from Jammu in the west to Assam in the\\neast. The Siwalik hills are mainly river deposits of the middle Miocene to the lower Pleistocene Age,\\nfolded into arches (anticlines) and troughs (synclines).

The modern society has lost sight of the\\nimportance of the traditional knowledge, which had been subjected to a process of refinement through\\ngenerations of experience. The eco logical considerations shown by the traditional farmers in their\\nfarming activities are now a days is reflected in the resurgence of organic agriculture.\\nThe available ancient literatur e includes the four Vedas, nine Br ahnanas, Aranyakas, Sutra litera-\\nture, Susruta Samhita, Charaka Samhita, Upanishads, the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, eighteen\\nPuranas, Buddhist and Jain literature, and texts such as Krishi-Parashara, Kautilya’s, Artha-sastra,\\nPanini’s Ashtadhyahi, Sangam literature of Tamils,  Manusmirit, V arahamihira’s Brhat Samhita,\\nAmarkosha, Kashyapiya-Krishisukti and Surapala’s Vriskshayurveda. This literature was most likely to\\nhave been composed between 6000 B.C. and 1000 A.D. The information related to the biodiversity and\\nagriculture (including animal husbandry) is available in these texts.\\nRig-Veda is the most ancient literary work of India. It believed that Gods were the foremost among\\nagriculturists. According to ‘Amarakosha’, Aryans were agriculturists. Manu and Kautilya prescribed\\nagriculture, cattle rearing and commerce as essential subjects, which the king must learn. According to\\nPatanjali the economy of the country depended on agriculture and cattle-breeding. Plenty of informa-\\ntion is available in ‘Puranas’, which reveals that ancient Indians had intimate knowledge on all agricul-\\ntural operations. Some of the well known ancient classics of India are namely, Kautilya’s‘Arthashastra’;\\nPanini’s ‘Astadhyayi’; Patanjali’s ‘Mahabhasya’; Varahamihira’s ‘Brahat Samhita’; Amarsimha’s\\n‘Amarkosha’ and Encyclopedic works of Manasollasa. These classics testify the knowledge and wis-\\ndom of the people of ancient period. Technical book deali ng exclusively with agriculture was Sage\\nParashara’s ‘Krishiparashara’ in 1000 A.D. Other important texts are Agni Purana and Krishi Sukti\\nattributed to Kashyap (500 A.D.). Ancient Tamil and Kannada works contain lot of useful information\\non agriculture in ancient India. Agriculture in India made tr emendous progress in the rearing of sheep\\nand goats, cows and buffaloes, trees and shrubs, spices and condiments, food and non-food crops, fruits\\nand vegetables and developed nature friendly far ming practices. These practices had social and reli-\\ngious undertones and became the way of life for the people. Domestic rites and festivals often synchro-\\nnized with the four main agricultural operations of ploughing , sowing, reaping and harvesting. In the'),\n",

The famous Cow Sukta (Rv. 6.28) indicates that\\nthe cow had already become the very basis of rural economy. In another Sukta, she is defined as the\\nmother of the Vasus, the Rudras and the Adityas, as also the pivot of immortality. The V edic Aryans\\nappear to have large forests at  their disposal for securing timber, and plants and herbs for medicinal\\npurposes appear to have been reared by the physicians of the age, as appears in the Atharva V eda. The\\nfarmers’ vocation was held in high regard , though agriculture solely depended upon the favours of\\nParjanya, the god of rain. His thunders are described as food-bringing.\\nThe four V edas mentioned more than 75 plant species, Satapatha Bhrahamna mentions over 25\\nspecies, and Charkaa Samhita (C. 300 B.C.) an Ayurvedic (Indian medicine) treatise-mentions more\\nthan 320 plants. Susruta (C. 400 B.C.) records over 750 medicinal plant species. The oldest book, Rig-\\nV eda (C. 4000 B.C.) mentions a large number of poisonous and non poisonous aquatic and terrestrial,\\nand domestic and wild creatures and animals. Puranas mention about 500 species of plants. The science\\nof arbori-horticulture had developed well and has been documented in Surapala’s Vrikshayurveda.\\nForests were very important in ancient times. From the age of Vedas, protection of forests was empha-\\nsized for ecological balance. Kautilya in his Artha sastra (321–296 B.C.) mentions that superintendent\\nof forests had to collect forest produce through the fo rest guards. He provides a long list of trees,\\nvarieties, of bamboos, creepers, fibrous plants,  drugs and poisons, skins of va rious animals, etc., that\\ncome under the purview of his officer. The preservation of wild animals was encouraged and hunting\\nas a sport was regarded as detrimental to proper development of the character and personality of the\\nruler, according to Manu (Manusmriti, 2nd Century B.C.). Specifically, in the Puranas (300–750 A.D.)\\nthe names of Shalihotra on horses, and Palakapya on elephants have been found as experts in animal\\nhusbandry. For instance, Garudapurana is a text dealing with treatment of animal disorders while the\\nclassical work on the treatment of horses is Aswashastra. One chapter/part in Agnipurana deals with the\\ntreatment of livestock and another on treatment of trees.\\n2.2 DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN CULTURE\\nThe traditional classification of human social evolution is into pre-history and recorded history. The\\nlatter follows the invention of writing and therefore written historical records. The large number of\\nprimitive stone tools found in the Soan V alley and South India suggests that the earliest races of human\\nexistence in India go back to the period between 400,000 and 200,000 B.C.

A study of human Y-chromosome variation in a worldwide\\nsample of over 1,000 men determined that Africans and non-Africans shared a common ancestor\\n59,000 years ago and that the non-African branch of humanity left Africa about 44,000 years ago. Other\\ndata shows that Africans and non-Africans split about 156,000 years ago. The true migration date is\\nsome time between these dates. There seems to be some correlation between these dates and the\\nappearance of modern humans as a species. The last common ancestor of all non-African human Y-\\nchromosomes is estimated to be about 40,000 years (31,000–79,000) ago. Another study of the Y-\\nchromosome of Europeans used 22 markers in 1,007 men across Europe over 80 per cent of the\\nEuropean genes were traced to two migrations of Paleolithic ancestors around 40,000 and 22,000 years\\nago, respectively. Twenty percent of the European genes were from Neolithic farmers who entered the\\ncontinent about 10,000 years ago. Early or primitive Homo sapiens  were adaptable, leading to the\\nadoption of diverse lifestyles based on locally available food resources. Early Europeans hunted rein-\\ndeer as did the Eskimo. Hunters met migratory herds in autumn on their return from summer tundra\\npastures to winter forest shelters. This meat could be frozen and used throughout the winter. Modern\\nEskimos, Australian aborigines and primitive inhabitants of Glacial Europe use a type of spear-thrower,\\nan early technological innovation. Early Europeans had to contend with lions, bears, bison, mammoths,\\nwoolly rhinoceros and wild ox. Wood for cave fires was collected from conifer forests. On the southern\\nsteppes there was less fuel, so bone served as fuel. Homo erectus remains in Sunderland (Java, Sumatra\\nand Borneo), of between 600,000 and 900,000 y ears old, represent the earliest evidence of our pre-\\nhuman ancestors in this region. The Australoid col onists of this area are represented today by the\\nAborigines of Australia, the Highlanders of New Guinea, the Negritos of Malaya and the Philippines.\\n2.2.2 Development of Human Culture\\n1. Stone age - The Pre-history Stone age is broken down into three periods, according to the material\\nused for making tools:\\n(i) The Paleolithic Period or Old/Ancient stone age (2.5 million-12,000 B.C.) - The age in human\\nculture was characterized by the use of rough or chipped stone tools. Man was essentially a food\\ngatherer and depended on nature for food. He learnt to control fire, which helped him to improve\\nhis way of living. At the end of this age, the modern human being (Homo sapiens) first appeared\\naround 36,000 B.C. The Paleolithic Period (Old Stone Age) is from 2.5 million-12,000 B.C.\\nwith earliest tool-making human beings and ends when people learned to produce higher quality\\ntools around 12,000 B.C. and to farm around 8,000 B.C. The Old Stone Age is the ‘Age of food-\\ngatherers’, while the New Stone Age (the New Stone Age or the Neolithic Age (12000 to 4000\\nB.C.)) is referred to as the ‘ Age of food producers ’. This puts the Bronze Age onwards as the\\n‘Age of civilization’, starting towards the end of the Neolithic Age. There are three major life-\\nstyle groupings viz., ( i) Hunter gatherer, ( ii) Agriculture, and ( iii)  Technological civilization.\\nCivilization requires, or may be defined by, settlement in definite territories, the building of'),\n",

This social system has and does exist together with the first two.  \\nHunter gatherers - Over the period called the Middle Paleolithic (called the Middle Stone Age\\nin Africa), 200,000 to 40,000 years ago, stone tools found are quite similar, representing a\\nuniform technology world-wide. The oldest site of tool use comes from East Africa where\\npebble tools were in use 1.7 million years ago. Tool and fire are ancient “landmarks” on the path\\nto humanity. There is evidence that fire was first used by Homo erectus at Ghoukoutien, China\\n300,000 to 400,000 years ago.\\n     Hunter-gatherers had a practical, bu t excellent knowledge of their natural environment, be it\\nplants, animals or the physical conditions. In productive areas, Australian aborigines had up to\\n250 food plants from which to choose. Poorer areas had about 50 food plants. Paleolithic (Stone)\\nAge lasted up to 12,000 B.C. Primitive man used tools and implements of rough stone. Man was\\nessentially a food gatherer and depended on nature for food.\\nIce Age (Upper Paleolithic - 35,000 to 8,000 B.C.) - During this period, a culture of mammoth\\nhunters lived in Eastern Europe and Siberia. These hunting nomads had a diet mostly of meat as\\ndid the Eskimos until recently. All their requirements would have come from their prey which\\nalso included bison, horses, reindeer, birds, fish, arctic foxes and hares. Vegetable foods would\\nhave formed a minor supplement. They even built huts from carefully interlocked mammoth\\nbones covered with skins. A typical Australian aborigine’s catch for the day may include snakes,\\nlizards, anteaters, frogs and grubs, and a wallaby or two. Semang people of Malaysia rely on\\nsmall creatures (fish, birds, rats, squirrels, lizards and sometimes wild pigs, tapirs and deer),\\nwild plants (nuts, berries, fruit, leaves, shoots, and tubers) and honey collected from the forest.\\nThey use a poisoned dart propelled from a two-metre long bamboo blowpipe to kill some\\nanimals.\\nBeginning of agriculture - Demographic pressure probably led to the adoption of crop cultiva-\\ntion and animal husbandry, leading to modern civilization. As the population grew, there was an\\nincreased dependence upon plants. Next, consumer demand within a constrained space forced\\nthe adoption of some form of intensive agriculture. Other evidence for this trend is found in Peru\\nwhere people domesticated camelids and guinea pigs 2,000 year s before crop cultivation. Agri-\\nculture would have been started with the end of the last Ice Age between 15,000 and 8,000 years\\nago. Before this, people living the hunter-gatherer lifestyle depended upon what was available.\\nHistorical evidences showed that agriculture started around 8,500 years ago from the Near East,\\nreaching Britain around 6,000 years ago and Spain and Portugal by 5,000 years ago. American\\nIndians of central Brazil, called, the Kayapo are a modern version of hunter gatherer people.\\nWith chickens, crops such as corn, sweet potatoes, sweet manioc and yams and a hunting\\nlifestyle they represent a transition from a hunter-gathering lifestyle to an agricultural lifestyle.\\nWhat they caught by hunting, be it a tortoise, deer, fish or a wild pig, they had to share and they\\ndiscouraged selfishness. Women worked in groups to gather fruit, nuts and plants from the same\\nforest where the men hunt. Ironically, on finding a high fruit tree, they cut it down with a metal\\naxe to harvest the ripe fruit. Domestic crops and animals become more important as food than\\nwild animals and plants. Agriculture is relatively new, only emerging between 12,000 and 8,000\\nyears ago and has often caused environmental damage, but has led to the social changes that\\nhave allowed the formation of our modern ci vilization. The domestication of dogs and turkeys\\nfollowed agriculture. People made tools such as bone reaping knives with flint cutting teeth\\n(Refer Table 1.1 of Chapter 1).'),\n",

With the introduction of agriculture, villages and cities became possible as people did not\\nhave to travel in search of food. (Civilization comes from the Latin word “ civitas” meaning city.) This\\nsedentary way of life formed the basis for modern civilization. Egypt and Mesopotamia had established\\nirrigation systems by 5,000 years ago. In China, people developed the iron plough by 2,600 years ago,\\nreplacing wood and stone ploughs as a more effective tool. They had also developed the mould board\\nplough by 2,100 years ago. Ancient people are r esponsible for the basic inventions such as the use of\\nfire, the use of metals such as gold and copper, bows and arrows, the fish hook, spinning and weaving,\\nagriculture, animal domestication, sail boats and ships, wells and irrigation, pottery, clothing, language,\\narithmetic, the alphabet and written communication in prehistoric times. The oldest evidence for the\\nbow and arrow, at 20,000 years old, comes from North Africa. Other agricultural inventions such as\\nseed drills have older origins, in use in Mesopotamia 5,500 years ago. People built the pyramid at\\nSaqqara over 4,600 years ago. Architects designed complex architectural concepts such as domes, built\\nin Ancient Cyprus 5,000 years ago. The discovery and use of  ‘metals’ was an important aspect of our\\ncultural evolution. Malleable metals allowed creations limited only by human imagination and so the\\ninvention of a far wider range of implements, tools and instruments than could be made with wood and\\nbone. Copper was found in almost pure form in some areas and so was one of the first metals used\\naround 10,000 years ago by the people living along the Euphrates and Tigris rivers in what is now Iraq.\\nGold was in use by 5,500 years ago. Roman dentists were using gold as tooth fillings 2,000 years ago.\\nSilver was in use 6,000 years ago. Egyptians produced ir on, the most difficult metal to separate from\\nits ore, 4,000 years ago. Assyrians had an advanced technology for iron smelting, even making steel\\nfrom iron. Labourer saving devices was commonly used in ancient Greece. They used the wedge, the\\nlever, the block with pulleys, the winch or windlass and the screw. Scientists such as Archimedes (2,300\\nyears ago) were involved in these developments, b ut were not the inventors.

Indian civilization, its ancientness and great cultural traditions go back to the\\ndawn of ages. This civilization was thought to have been confined to the valley of the river Indus, hence\\nthe name given to it was Indus V alley civilization. This civilization was a highly developed urban one\\nand two of its towns, Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, represent the hi gh watermark of the settlements.\\nSubsequent archaeological excavations established that the contours of this civilization were not\\nrestricted to the Indus valley but spread to a wide area in northwestern and western India. Thus this\\ncivilization is now better known as the Harappan civilization. Mohenjo-daro and Harappa are now in\\nPakistan and the principal sites in India include Ropar in Punjab, Lothal in Gujarat and Kalibangan in\\nRajasthan. Recent research has shown Sutkagen Dor in Baluchistan next to Iran is the western most\\nknown Harappan site. The Indus V alley Civilization stretched across the whole of Sindh, Baluchistan,\\nPunjab, Northern Rajasthan, Kathia war and Gujarat. This civilization is one of the three great early\\ncivilizations that arose in the late fourth and third millennia B.C. around the three large alluvial systems\\nof the Tigris-Euphrates, Nile and Indus rivers. I ndia laid stress on a deep culture without neglected\\nmaterial life. Indian can be pride comparing with Americans or Australians civilization which has taken\\ntwo centuries old and material achievements.\\n2.4.1 Physical Data\\nThe Harappan civilization compr ises of more than 1,500 settlements, most of them small villages or\\ntowns, with only a few lar ge cities. Some of the “villages” covered more than twenty hectares; the\\ncities, in comparison, often extended over some eighty hectares—Mohenjo-daro up to 250 hectares.\\nThe southern limit was between the Tapti and the Godava ri rivers, while the northern limit was some\\n1,400 km away in Kashmir (at Manda)—though one site, Shortughai, is found still farther up, in'),\n",

The old Sarasvati river courses from the Sutlej, flowed through Northern Rajasthan,\\nBahawalpur and Sind found its way into the Arabian Sea via Rann of Kutch in the third to second\\nmillennium B.C. Etymologically, Sarasvati means ‘abundance of lakes (saras)’. The synonym of Sarasvati\\n(goddess of vak = speech or language) is brahmi which is the name given to the early scripts used in\\nAsoka’s epigraphs of circa 300 B.C. Jonathan Mark Kenoyer, a U.S. archaeologist, who has worked on\\nmany Indus sites, dated 5000–2600 B.C.\\n2.4.2 River Migrations in Western India\\nThe dried-up bed of Sarasvati might have constituted the great road between Hastinapur and Dwaraka.\\nGeographically, the Sarasvati basin can be traced to the currently known: ghaggar channels. Ghaggar\\nmight have been a stream that rose in the Siwaliks and that joined the Sarasvati. This network runs\\nparallel to the Indus across Sind. The river flowed from the Himalayas to the Rann of Kutch. Geologi-\\ncally, the entire Sarasvati riverbed, and the arm of the Arabian sea (formerly spanning into saline Ranns\\nof kutch) into which the river fell are on an earthquake belt; an earthquake could have upraised this\\nentire river-sea-bed profile, drying up the river.  This may explain the formation of the Thar desert on\\nthe left banks of the river in earlier earthquakes; also, perhaps of the Thar desert in Pakistan. Did some\\ntracts of the Thar desert support cultivation in ancient times? Geological surveys do indicate subsoil\\nwater in some tracts. Even today, over 2 million people in Rajasthan live in these tracts! The Sanskrit\\nname is maru-sthall. cf. Tamil maruta-nilam].\\nThe Indus river has a very wide flood plain on either side of its course up to a maximum width of\\n100–120 km in the east and southeast. To have such a wide flood plain on only one side shows that the\\nIndus river has preferentially migrated towards the north-west in the northern parts and towards the\\nwest in the central and southern parts. The study of remotely sensed data in the desert tract of Rajasthan\\nshows that there are plenty of paleochannels with well sprung-up tentacles throughout the desert. On\\nthe northern edge of the Thar-Great Indian desert at the Ganganagar-Anupgarh plains a well-developed\\nset of palaeochannels are clearly discernible in sa tellite photographs. The Saraswati river once flowed\\nclose to the Aravalli hill ranges and met the Arabian sea in the Rann of Kutch that it has migrated\\ntowards the west, the northwest and the north and has ultimatel y got lost in the Anupgarh plains.\\n“...Remote sensing study of the Great Indian Desert reveals that the Saraswati river, which is\\nbelieved to be lost in the desert, could be traced through these palaeochannels as a migratory river. Its\\ninitial course flowed close to the Aravalli ranges and successive six stages took west and northwesterly\\nshifts till it coincides with the dry bed of Ghaggar river. The groundwater, archaeological and pedological\\ndata with selected ground truths also corroborates these findings. The migration of river Saraswati\\nseems to be caused by tetonic disturbances in Hardwar-Delhi ridge zone, Luni-Surki lineament, Cambay\\nGraben and Kutch fault facilitated by contrasting climatic variations. The stream piracy by Yamuna\\nriver at later stage is responsible for the ultimate loss of water and drying up of the Saraswati river...”\\nClimate change - The Indus V alley Culture seen in the context of post-glacial climatic and ecological\\nstudies in North-West India: suggests that “...the significant increase in rainfall at the beginning of the\\nthird millennium B.C., attested by palaeoecological evidence, played an important part in the sudden\\nexpansion of the Neolithic-Chalcolithic cultures in north-west India, ultimatel y leading to the\\nprosperity of the Indus culture... The present evidence would suggest that the onset of aridity in the\\nregion around 1800 B.C. probably resulted in the weakening of the Harappan culture in the arid and\\nsemi-arid parts of north-west India...”'),\n",

With the discovery of another major site at Mohenjo-daro in the same decade, it\\nwas re-christened as Indus civilization. Since 1950’s a number of new type sites have been located. In\\nparticular, the sites of Rupar, Kalibangan, Lothal, Dholavira and Banawali. The characteristic feature of\\nthe location of these sites is that these are on the banks of or very close to the ‘lost’ sarasvati river.\\nHence, the civilization should be re-christened as Indus-Sarasvati civilization. Sarasvati river is extolled\\nin the Rigvedas. Kalibangan and Lothal may not be as grandiose as the urban Harappa but are typical\\nIndus/Sarasvati civilization sites. The lost Saraswati river course has established the existence of a river\\nflowing down from the Siwalik ranges and also the changes in the courses of the Indus tributaries and\\nthe Y amuna rivers. As Y amuna and Sutlej captured the water sources, Sarasvati might have dried up,\\naided by the upraising of land caused by earthquakes. A part of the river exists as Ghaggar in Haryana;\\nthe rest of it has disappeared in the fringes of the maru-sthall or the thar desert.\\n(a) The Cities  - Harappan cities displayed the most sophisticated town-planning. Geometrically\\ndesigned, the towns had fortifications (for protection against both intruders and floods), several\\ndistinct quarters, assembly halls, and manufacturing units of various types ; some bigger cities\\nhad furnaces for the production of copper tools, weapons or ornaments ; public baths (probably\\noften part of temples), private baths for most inhabitants, sewerage through underground drains\\nbuilt with precisely laid bricks, and an efficient water management with numerous reservoirs\\nand wells show that the ordinary inhabitant was well taken care of. Mohenjo-daro, for instance,\\nis thought to have had over 700 wells, some of them fifteen metres deep, built with special\\ntrapezoid bricks (to prevent collapse by the pressure of the surrounding soil). The Indian archae-\\nologist, B.B. Lal, writes in a recent compr ehensive study of this civilization: “ Well-regulated\\nstreets [were] oriented almost invariably along with the cardinal directions, thus forming a grid-\\niron pattern, even the widths of these streets were in a set ratio, i.e., if the narrowest lane was\\none unit in width, the other streets were twice, thrice and so on. Such a town-planning was\\nunknown in contemporary West Asia.\\n(b) Agriculture, Technology and Trade in Harappa during 1600 B.C. - In the Chalcolithic period,\\nHarappans had reached a high state of culture. They wore cotton garments and used ivory combs\\nand copper mirrors. The women wore ornaments of bronze and gold. They used implements\\nsuch as sickles, saws, knife blades, spears, axes, arrowheads and daggers made of bronze and\\ncopper fish-hooks. Specialized occupation besides agriculture developed and these articles were\\nproduced by skilled craftsman such as coppersmiths, carpenters, jewelers, goldsmiths, stone\\ncutters and potters. Trade with other countries especially with Mesopotamia flourished and\\nsome items such as metals timber and precious stones were imported. Harappans cultivated\\nbread wheat, barley, sesame, pea, melon, date palm and Brassica spp. Gossypium arboreum was\\nan important crop, the centre of its origin the Indus Valley. Harappan culture covered a very vast\\narea in north India with very strong settlements at various sites in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab,\\nHaryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The rice cultivated in Harappa\\nhad long seeded grain and perhaps was the ancestor of the fragrant basmati rice. Wheat and\\njowar were the other food crops.\\n(c) Neolithic (7500–6500 B.C.) and Chalcolithic (2295–1300 B.C.)  - The main crops under culti-\\nvation were jowar, bajra, and ragi ( Eleusine coracana). Minor millets such as kangni ( Setaria\\nitalica), kundon ( Paspalum milliaceum) and sannuk ( Echinochloa frumentacea) were also cul-\\ntivated. Other crops were kulthi ( Dolichos bifiorus), mung ( Vigna radiata), mash (urd; black'),\n",

Wood\\nof teak (Tectona grandis), Acacia sp., Albizia sp, and Ziziphus mauritiana were used for making\\nagriculture implements and for timber. The wood of Zizphus mauritiana was used for marking\\nmoosal (mortar).\\nThe plant domestication, diffusion development in ancient India and borderlands was a gradual\\ntransition from full time hunting-foraging practices which took place in several geographical\\nregions and chronological settings, viz., the north western sector, Baluchistan, Pakistan and its\\nborderlands with Iran and Afghanistan during Neolithic period between 8000 and 5500 B.C. In\\nthe early Chalcholithic phase (4700–4300 B.C.) wheat, hulled and naked barley was cultivated.\\nFruits of jujube, prunus and cotton were added to the plant economy besides dates. Practice of\\nhigh yielding hexaploid wheat (bread, club and dwarf) and barley (hulled and naked) also\\ncontinued. Crop remains of wheat (emmer, bread, club and dwarf) and hulled barley from 3500\\nto 3200 B.C. along with apricots. During 3200–2500 B.C., barley (6 row hulled, 6 row naked,\\n6 row shot) lentil, chickpea, flax/linseed, jujube, grape, cotton and dates were grown. Besides\\nrice, indigenous people of India had domesticated seve ral species of minor millets, grain, leg-\\numes, oil seed crops fiber crops, fruits, vegetables and other economic plant species in the\\nIndus–Saraswati Yamuna Ganga valleys. Farmers practiced barely and rice rotation at Atranjikhera\\n(e.g., 2000–1500 B.C.) in association with grass pea and chickpea. Farmers cultivated rice, black\\ngram and green gram in the rainy season and bread and lentil in winter. The people ate, besides\\ncereals, vegetables and fruits, fish, fowl, mutton, beef and pork. Perhaps the most r emarkable\\nachievement was the cultivation of cotton. There was an extensive network of canals for\\nirrigation.\\nThe Sumerians developed the plough about 2900 B.C. Possibly the Harappans learnt the use\\nof the plough from the Sumerians. All primitive ploughs were made of wood, and wood is a\\nperishable material. A terracotta model of a plough, 7 cm × 19.7 cm has been discovered from\\nMohenjo-daro. This toy plough is kept in the Prince of Wales Museum, Bombay. There is a\\nlongish beam and the plough breast terminates in a rectangular manner. There is no indication\\nthat it had a handle ( munna) for the ploughman to hold. The people of Kalibangan had domes-\\nticated cattle, and carried on agriculture. To the southeast of the pre-Harappan settlement a\\nploughed field was discovered. It showed a grid of furrows, with one set more closely spaced\\n(about 30 cm apart) running east-west, and the other widely spaced (about 1.90 metres apart),\\nrunning north south. This pattern bears a remarkable r esemblance to ploughing as is now\\ncarried, where mustard and gram are grown in two sets of furrows in the same field.\\nS.R. Rao in his monograph, Lothal and the Indus Civilization, has reproduced a photograph\\nof a seal from Lothal, which he feels depicts a seed drill. But its shape is rather unusual for a\\nseed-drill. Ox-drawn sledges were still being used about 3000 B.C. at Dr to convey royal corpses\\nto their final resting-place. But long before that da te, the sledge had been transformed by an\\ninvention that revolutionized locomotion on land. The wheel was the crowning achievement of\\nprehistoric carpentry; it is the pre-condition of modern machinery, and, applied to transport, it\\nconverted the sledge into a cart or wagon. Wheeled vehicles are represented in the Sumerian art\\nas early as 3500 B.C., and in nor thern Syria perhaps even earlier. By 3000 B.C., carts, wagons,\\nand even chariots were in general use in Elam, Mesopotamia and Syria. In the Indus V alley,\\nwheeled carts were in use when the archaeological record begins about 2300 B.C. and at about\\nthe same date in Turkistan too. Children’s toys from Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Lothal and\\nChandigarh include some wheeled carts, which indicate that they were in use in ordinary t-life.'),\n",

The people made extensive use of the\\nwooden plough. Kalibangan even yielded a field ploughed with two perpendicular networks of\\nfurrows, in which higher crops (suc h as mustard) were grown in the spaced-out north-south\\nfurrows, thus casting shorter shadows, while shorter crops (such as gr am) filled the contiguous\\neast-west furrows. This is a technique still used today in the same region. There is also evidence\\nof the domestication of cats, dogs, goats, sheep and perhaps, the elephant.\\nIndus civilization society capable of town-planning, shipping, refined arts and crafts, writing,\\nsustained trading, necessarily has to master a good deal of technology. Symbols of Indus religion\\nand culture were incorporated into pottery, ornaments and everyday tools in a way that helped\\nto unite people within the urban centers and link them with distant rural communities.  The\\ncotton textiles, ivory and copper were exported to Mesopotamia, and possibly China and Burma\\nin exchange for silver and other commodities. Production of several metals such as copper,\\nbronze, lead and tin was also undertaken. The Indus people did not know iron. The people were\\nvery artistic in the pottery, stone sculpture and seal making. The discovery of kilns to make\\nbricks support the fact that burnt bricks were used extensively in domestic and public buildings.\\nThe people had commercial links with Afghanistan, Persia, Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Sa-\\nmaritans. Trade was in the form of ‘barter’. There was a cleverly organized system of weights\\nand measures.\\n(d) Government and social evolution  -  The Harappan political organization as an empire, with\\nMohenjo-daro as the seat of the emperor and a number of “governors” in the regional capitals,\\nothers are in favour of regional states. Mohenjo-daro is thought to have sheltered at least 50,000\\ninhabitants.\\n(e) The Aryan problem - The relationship of the Indus-Saraswati civilization with the later Indian\\ncivilization remains a subject of debate. T he ancient dwellers in India were Dravidians, and in\\nfact, their culture had developed a highly sophisticated way of life. The existence of the Brahui\\ntribe in Baluchistan, to the west of the Indus, who speak a Dravidian language like South Indian\\nTamil, gives evidence that a migration of people or culture did occur. The language of Indus\\nV alley civilization appears to be Dravidian akin to Old Tamil, presently spoken throughout the\\nsouthern part of the Indian Peninsula. Maru is the Sanskrit name of the desert that lies between\\nthe Indus-Sarasvati river valleys of south Asia. It is also called ‘ thar’ in India and ‘ thal’ in\\nPakistan. The habitation ‘Maru’ land was once marsh, the Indus-Sarasvati river valley inundated\\narea, which supported agriculture. Similarly the word ‘Maru’ as marsh-land, river valley is used\\nas ‘marutam’ indicating the agricultural tracts in Tamil language. A study of the evolution of\\nscripts in India indicates that the Dravidians, over the centuries, have made the key contributions\\nto the development of language and literature in India.\\nThe theory of an Aryan invasion or even migration into India is as follows:\\n1. The Aryans migrated from their original home in Europe or Central Asia. The Harappan\\ntowns were destroyed by semi-barbarian Aryans rushing down on their horse chariots. The\\nAryans are said to have entered India through the Khyber Pass and invaded or perhaps more\\npeacefully intermingled with the Indus V alley peoples at least since 1600 B.C., and perhaps\\nearlier. The Aryans cross the River Sindhu and settled in a region called Saptsindu, or the\\nland of seven rivers (now known as the Punjab, the land of five rivers). The Aryans were\\nIndo-European warlike herders from Asian steppes. Bronze users and horse handlers,\\nAryans had a superior military and their cavalry warfare enabled them to spread their culture'),\n",

Aryans spoke the Sanskrit language (the basis of a\\nmajority of Indian languages today), had a polytheist religion (one basis of Hinduism) with\\na rich pantheon of deities, and a stratified class system:  with Kshatriyas (warriors) to rule,\\nand Brahmins (priests and teachers) at the top of the social hierarchy, supported by V aisyas\\n(farmers) and the Sudras (outcasts).

Raymond and Bridget Allchin,  archaeologists, now admit that the arrival of Indo-Aryans in\\nNorthwest India is “ scarcely attested in the archaeological record, presumably because\\ntheir material culture and life-style were already vir tually indistinguishable from those of\\nthe existing population .”\\n3. British anthropologist, Edmund Leach also termed t he Aryan invasion theory as being born\\nout of European racism.\\n4. Jim Shaffer, 1984 wrote: “ Current archaeological data do not support the existence of an\\nIndo-Aryan or European invasion into South Asia any time in the pre- or protohistoric\\nperiods. Instead, it is possible to document arc haeologically a series of cultural changes\\nreflecting indigenous cultural developments from prehistoric to historic periods. ”\\n5. Kenoyer, whom I quoted earlier, concludes in his recent beautiful book : “ Many scholars\\nhave tried to correct this absurd theory [of an Aryan invasion], by pointing out misinter-\\npreted basic facts, inappropriate models and an uncritical reading of Vedic texts. However,\\nuntil recently, these scientific and well-reasoned arguments were unsuccessful in rooting out\\nthe misinterpretations entrenched in the popular literature. [...] But there is no archaeologi-\\ncal or biological evidence for invasions or mass migrations into the Indus V alley between\\nthe end of the Harappan Phase, about 1900 B.C. and the beginning of the Early Historic\\nperiod around 600 B.C.”\\n6. Kenneth A.R. Kennedy, a U.S. expert who has extensively studied such skeletal remains,\\nobserves : “All prehistoric human remains recovered thus far from the Indian subcontinent\\nare phenotypically identifiable as ancient South Asians. [...] In short, there is no evidence\\nof demographic disruptions in the north-wester n sector of the subcontinent during and\\nimmediately after the decline of the Harappan culture ”.\\n7. No invasion or migration caused or followed the collapse of the urban phase of the Indus-\\nSarasvati civilization around 1900 B.C. The Harappans were just North-western Indians of\\nthe time and continued to live there even after the end of the urban phase (with some of them\\nmigrating towards the Ganga plains in search of greener pastures).\\n8. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, famous for his work on the Indian Constitution, as well as his campaign\\nin support of the nation’s dalit community noticed the racial overtones underlying the theory\\nand described the British espousal of the Aryan Invasion theory in the following words:\\n“The theory of invasion is an invention.

Their name is derived from the Indo-European root word, “ar,” mean-\\ning “noble.” In Sanskrit, they were the “Aryas” (“Aryans”); but that root, “ar,” would also serve as the\\nfoundation of the name of the conquered Persian territories, “Iran.” This concept of nobility, in fact,\\nseems to lie at the heart of Indo-European consciousness, for it appears in another country’s name,\\n“Ireland,” or “Eire.” The Aryans were a tribal and nomadic peoples living in the steppe lands of Euro-\\nAsia. They were a tough people, fierce and war-lik e. Their culture was oriented around warfare. They\\nwere ruled over by a war-chief, or ‘raja’ (the Latin word “rex” (king) comes from the same root word,\\nalong with the English “regal”). They travel on horseback and rushed into battle in chariots. They began\\nto migrate southwards in waves of steady conquest across the face of Persia and the lands of India in\\n2000 B.C. They swept over Persia with lightening speed, and spread across the northern river plains of\\nIndia. They penetrated India from the north-west, settling first in the Indus valley and then along the\\nGanges floodplain. The Aryans, or V edic civilization (Rigvedic Period 1700–1000 B.C.) were a new\\nstart in Indian culture. These tribes spread quickly  over northern India and the Deccan. Rig V eda is\\nbelieved to represent the Indo-European religion and have many characteristics in common with\\nPersian religion since the two peoples are closely related in time. In this early period, their population was\\nrestricted to the Punjab in the northern reaches of the Indus River and the Yamuna River near the Ganges.\\nThey maintained the Aryan tribal structure, with a raja ruling over the tribal group in tandem with a\\ncouncil. Each jana seems to have had a chief priest; the religion was focused almost entirely on a series\\nof sacrifices to the gods. The Rigvedic peoples originally had only two social classes: nobles and\\ncommoners. Eventually, they added a third: Dasas, or “darks.” These were the darker-skinned people\\nthey had conquered. The word ‘Varna’ is used in the Rig Veda never refers to the Brahmana or Kshatriya.\\nBy the end of the Rigvedic period, social class had settled into four rigid castes: the ‘caturvarnas’,\\n‘Varna’ or “four colours.” At the top of the caturvarnas were the priests, or ‘ Brahmans’. Below the\\npriests were the warriors or nobles (Kshatriya ), the craftspeople and merchants ( V aishya), and the\\nservants (Shudra), who made up the bulk of society. In the early centuries of ‘ Later V edic Period’ or\\n‘Brahmanic Period’ (1000–500 B.C.), the Aryans migrated across the Doab, which is a large plain,\\nwhich separates the Yamuna river from the Ganges. The Later Vedic Period is the ‘Epic Age’; the great\\nliterary, heroic epics of Indian culture, the ‘Ramayana’ and the ‘ Mahabharata’, though they were\\ncomposed between 500 and 200 B.C., were probably originally formulated and told in the Later V edic\\nPeriod. The most ancient scared Aryan literature of Hinduism is called the Vedas. The V edas consist of\\nfour collections called the Rig-Veda, the Sama-Veda, the Yajur-Veda, and the Atharva-Veda. Collec-\\ntively, these are referred to as the Samhitas. The Rig-Veda mentioned ‘Indra’, the god of war and\\nwe\\nather, ‘Agni’, the god of fire. The hierarchy of the gods was from Indra and V aruna to the two current\\nsects of Hinduism, which worship Vishnu and Shiva. The best of the V edic Shlokas refer to a common\\nlife-spirit that links all living creatur es, to human social-interconnectedness, to the notion of unity in'),\n",

Vedic period (1600 B.C.–1000 B.C.) - The early home of Aryans was in south Russia in the\\nsteppes between the Danube the Volga, and the Urals. There was another verse that the home-\\nland of Aryans was Germany. The Aryans left this homeland during 1600 B.C., and dispersed\\neast and west in large groups. Early Vedic Aryans were primarily pastoral and settled in Indus\\nvalley. They cut jungles, built their villages, grazed their cattle in jungles and planted barley in\\nthe land close to their habitation. V edic Aryans were accustomed to cows, horses; buffalo was a\\nnew animal, which they called gouri, or govala, which appears to be an extension of the word\\ngau (cow). Indus valley is the land of seven rivers was called ‘Saptasindhavah’. The seven rivers\\nincluded the five rivers of the Punjab (meaning land of five rivers) viz., the Sutudri (Sutlej), the\\nVipas, (Beas), the Parushini (Ravi) and the Askini (Chenab) and the remaining two includes the\\nIndus and Saraswathi. Aryans began to move in search of water when the river Saraswati dried\\nup. It was king Bhahirath whose efforts brought the Ganga into the plains of India and storage\\ncultures in the Indo-Gangetic plains developed. The Aryans have been identified as nomads they\\nalways moved in search of pasturelands for their animals. Their culture has been based on met,\\ncamped and departed. This culture is superior to that of the people who were already living for\\nmillennia in India and had developed agriculture. Domesticated animals made strong settle-\\nments and created a class of artisans and craftsman. One of the strong arguments in the favour\\nof Aryan invasion from the steppes in Russia is the introduction of horse in India by them. When\\nduring the Chalcolithic period, trade with Mesopotamia and other cultures was being carried\\nout, the horse could have been brought to India while cotton cloth and other articles were\\nexported. Even during the time of Chandragupta Mayurya, in the bazaars, horses brought by\\ntraders from the Middle East were on sale.\\n2. Rigveda - Rigveda the oldest book that was complied around 3700 B.C.

The sun is the\\nprotector, the purifier and the source of prosperity. The water cycle is described as water\\ngoing up form earth in the summer through evaporation, cloud formation and water coming\\ndown again in the from of rain. Loss of surface water in summer must have been easy to\\nobserve. There are six seasons in a year; namely Grishma (May–June), V arsha (July–August),\\nHemant (September–October), Sharad (November–December), Shishir (January–February)\\nand Vasant (March–April). The beginning of the rainy season (obviously in Pakistan\\nNorth–West India) is after 21 June when the sun starts ‘moving south’. There existed of\\ndams on the seven rivers. Constructing dams on rivers must have meant cutting off water to\\nV edic people to irrigate lands and to provide water to people and animals after the rains the\\ncontribution of rivers to increasing the food production.\\n(ii) Farming resources and practices (Rigveda) -  A farmer plows his fields repeatedly. Sun\\nbrought six seasons, which repeat in a sequence. Bullock cart and chariot were used for\\ncrossing Sutlej and Vyas rivers. Tie bullocks to the plow, join yokes, sow the seed, let the\\nfood produced be sufficient and let the sickle fall on the ripe crop. Sum ps were constructed\\nto provide drinking water for animals, leather ropes and irrigation from never-drying pits.\\nField operations to raise crops were well established. Using a plow to cultivate land and\\nraise barley was already an “ancient practice” for the V edic Aryans. Soils of different kinds\\nand productive and non-productive fields were recognized. Soil preparation was done through\\nrepeated plowings. Classification of seasons into six different kinds as is followed even\\ntoday was done. A bamboo stick of a specific size was used for measuring land. Soaking of\\nsoil profile with water was carried out to f acilitate plowing and sowing operations. Well\\nwater was used for drinking purpose but irrigation from shallow wells was practiced.\\nReference to irrigation possibly from rivers was found. Bullock power was used for plowing\\nand for pulling bullock carts and chariots to cross-rivers such as Sutlej and Vyas undoubtedly\\nin the post rainy season. Labourers were available for work. Other farm operations included\\nbird scaring, harvesting with sickle, threshing, winnowing with titau (suba), storing gains in\\nstorage bins and burning of trash/wastes. Barley was ratooned on residual moisture possibly\\nfor fodder after harvest of grain crop. Apar t from barley, other cereals were consumed.\\nBarley was roasted obviously to make saktu (sattu or flour from roasted barley grain).\\n(iii) Forestry (Rigveda) - Trees such as pippala (peepal), khadir, shisham palasa shalmali and\\nurvaruka are mentioned. Pippala is treated as sacred tree. Urvaruka fruits are edible. Khadir\\nand shisham wood used for making chariots are used even today to make furniture. Several\\ngrasses are mentioned. Some of which are still used in religious ceremonies and in making\\nrope, mats cottage roofs etc.\\n(iv) Animal husbandry (Rigveda) - A cow having a copious stream of milk yields, in the\\npresence of their calf. Do not kill a cow who is mother of Rudras, daughter or V asus, sister\\nof Aditya, milk-bearing innocent and without any complex. V arious animals referred in'),\n",

Two colours of cows\\nare mentioned black and red. Cows with a long nose seem to have been preferred. Camels,\\ndonkeys and horses were used for riding and possibly for carrying loads. Stealing cows is\\nreferred in Rigveda considering the fact that cattle meant wealth. Cows belonging to\\nenemies were looted. Chickpea was used as a horse feed because even today water-soaked\\nchickpea is considered to be a good feed for horses. Cleaning of horses was obviously\\npreferred. On management of cows, grazing in forests seems to have been common practice.\\nCows were permitted to graze in barley fields and cattle owners apparently knew the\\nbenefits of providing clean safe water from ponds. Dogs were used f or managing herds of\\ncows and for recovering stolen cows. Calling cows for milking with some grass in hand by\\nthe boys obviously looked after cows while the y grazed. Burning of dried cow dung is\\npracticed as fuel for fire. Killing of cows was clearly discouraged not only because it played\\nan important part in human subsistence, b ut also for the cow’s innocence.\\nIn the later V edic period (1000–600 B.C.), agriculture implements were improved. Iron\\nploughshares were used.\\n3. End of the Indus civilization - After 1750 B.C., the Mohenjo-daro and Harappan culture slowly\\ndeclined and gradually faded out. The cause or causes of the end of the Indus civilization are not\\neasy to determine. Some ascribe this to the decreasing fertility of the soil on account of the\\nincreasing salinity, caused by the expansion of the neighbouring desert. Others attribute it to\\nsome kind of depression in the land, which caused floods. At Mohenjo-daro groups of sprawling\\nskeletons in this period suggests some sort of massacre or invasion. The destroyers of the Indus\\ncities were members of the group of tribes whose priests composed the Rig V eda. The Indus\\nValley culture moved from west to east of Ganga-Jamuna-Doab region, with sites towards\\ncentral and southern India flourishing after Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had declined. The Ramayan\\npartly unfolded the tale of the Aryan advent into the south. Even though there are various\\ntheories for the downfall of this civilization, there is no clear picture as to how or why it came\\nto an end.\\n4. Status of farmers in society - Agriculture and Animal Husbandry began to be developed in\\nIndia from pre-Vedic times. In Rigveda, there was reference to hundreds and thousands of cows;\\nto horses yoked to chariots; to racecourses where chariot races were held; to camels yoked to the\\nchariots; to sheep and goat-offered as sacrificial victims, and to the use of wool for clothing. The\\nfamous Cow-Sukta indicates that the cow had already become the very basis of rural economy.\\nIn another Sukta, she is deified as the mother of the V asus, the Rudras and the Adityas, as also\\nthe pivot of immortality. The Vedic Aryans appear to have large forests at their disposal for\\nsecuring timber, and plants and herbs for medicinal purposes appear to have been reared by the\\nphysicians of the age, as appears in the Atharva Veda. The farmers’ vocation was held in high\\nregards though agriculture solely depended upon the favours of Parjanya, the god of rain. His\\nthunders are prescribed as food bringing. Tree planting and preservation was one of the funda-\\nmental articles of Hindu religion, for the Indian culture from its inception grew under the shades\\nof trees where the Rishis dwelt. Different kinds of trees and their importance in life, for use as\\nwell as beauty, were studied with great care. In social rank, the farmers were considered next to\\nBrahmans, and the entire village administration appears to have been in the hands of leading\\nfarmers who were known as “Kutumbin”, from which the word “Kunbi” is derived. Even in the\\nmedieval period under the Hindu rulers, ample evidence for testifying to the expert skill in\\nraising crops such as wheat, gram, pulses, barley, sugarcane, indigo, cotton, pepper and ginger,'),\n",

The farmers only paid 1/6th to\\n1/12th of their agricultural products to the State.\\n1. Arthasastra  - Uses the same epithet to describe the qualities of a good country. The advance\\nmade in irrigation may be imagined from the anecdote that when a teacher sent his pupil to\\nstop a breach in the water-course of a certain field, the latter had to lie down to stop the flood\\nand prevent vital injury to the crops. The position is confirmed by a parable the implication\\nof which is that guards were employed at the vital spots of embankments, the rupture\\nwhereof would cause a great flood and damage. The King should be vigilant at danger-gates\\nas at the dam of a large water-work.\\nArthasastra significantly recommends upland (sthala) and low land (kedara) to be entered\\nseparately in the field register of the gopa and enjoins a three-fold gradation of villages after\\nthe manner of Gautama and Manu upon the revenue officer (Samahartar; Sukraniti). This\\ntogether with a similar reference in Sukraniti, indicates that differential rates for different\\nclasses of soils are intended. The Agnipurana again mentioned revenue rates for different\\nkinds of paddy crops. Thus the land assessment varied according to the quality of land and\\nthe nature of the crop, the sadbhaga was only a traditional or average rate, not the fixed or\\nuniversal rate, in this respect resembling somewhat the ‘tithe’ in European fiscal terminology.\\nA careful gradation of land, survey and measurement, calculation of out turn as well as\\nexpenses per unit of land was mentioned in Manu, the Arthasastra and the Sumaniti. The\\nking’s share did not necessarily mean a fixed share. It was determined by consideration of\\nfertility of the soil and by the needs of the State or of the cultivator. The system of measurement\\nand survey and differentiation of soil according to productivity also indicates that land\\nrevenue assessment was not permanent but revised at intervals although a constant revision\\nwas not necessary. In Buddha’s time irriga tion contrivances hardly excelled the old V edic\\nmechanisms; water was drawn by means of the lever, (tulam), the bullock-team.\\n2. Peasant’s under Mughal rule  - The Arabs were also innovators in agriculture. They had\\nimproved systems of irrigation. They wrote scientific treatises on farming. They excelled in\\nhorticulture, knowing how to graft and how to produce new varieties of fruits and flowers.\\nIbn Battuta (The Traveller of Islam): He traveled over the greater part of Asia, and visited\\nIndia in the regime of Muhammad-bin-Tughlak.\\n(i) Peasant economy - Of the produce of land, a large share went to the State in the form\\nof the land-tax and various perquisites. Of the remainder, a customary share was fixed\\nfor various classes of domestic and other labourers. The peasant and his family kept the\\nrest for their own use. A certain propor tion went to the share of the priest and the\\ntemple. The carpenters, the smiths, the potters, the washerman, the scavengers, etc.,\\nwere better off as they had to incur no expenditure, e.g., on feeding of livestock, and\\npayment in cash and kind to agricultural labourers.\\n(ii) Trade - The official weights under the Sultans of Delhi were fixed at an average of 28.78\\nIb (13.05 kg) to a mound.\\n(iii) Land revenue cess and taxes - The land-tax during Arab rulers was usually rated at two-\\nfifths of the produce of wheat and barley, if the fields were watered by public canals;\\nthree-tenths, if irrigated by wheels or other artificial means; and one-fourth, if alto-\\ngether unirrigated. If arable land was left uncultivated, one-tenth of the probable pro-\\nduce has to be paid. Of dates, grapes and garden produce, one-third was taken, either\\nin kind or money; and one-fifth (khums) of the yield of wines, fishing, pearls, and'),\n",

The Land-tax was the main\\nsource of revenue in Mughal India.\\nThe objects of Akbar’s revenue system were firstly to obtain a correct measurement of the land.\\nSecondly, the amount of the produce of each bigha of the land was too ascertained and to fix the\\nproportion of that amount that the cultivator should pay to the government. Thirdly, to settle an\\nequivalent for the proportion so fixed, in money. The Land-tax was the main source of revenue\\nin Mughal India. Status of farmers, however, changed with the establishment of the Turkish rule.\\n“If an Empire has to stay, farmers should be exploited”, said Allaudin Khilji, who used to\\ncollect half of the earnings of the farmers. Except during the short period under Akbar, who\\nelaborated the land reforms outlined by Sher Shah, exploitation of the farmers became the rule.\\nNaturally, the status of the farmers suffered and his skill came to be restricted to traditional\\nmethods.\\nThe flight of peasants from the land intensified dur ing the reign of Aurangzeb. As the peasants\\nnumber decreased, the income of the assignees, the jagirdars, was reduced. The jagirdars, to\\nmake good their loss, put incr eased pressure on the working peasants. Moreover, the practice\\ndeveloped of selling governments of provinces for immense sums in hard cash. Hence, it\\nnaturally became the principal object of the individual thus appointed Governor, to obtain repay-\\nment of the purchase-money, which he had borrow ed at a ruinous rate of interest. This in turn\\nresulted in more repression on the cultivators.\\n2.4.4 Status of Farmers in Southern India\\nThe Indian Council of Agricultural Research published a book entitled ‘Sons of the Soil’ in 1941 in\\nwhich status of the farmers of the different States of India had been discussed. The southern states of\\nIndia, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka (Mysore), Tamil Nadu (Madras) and Kerala are separated from the\\nIndo-Gangetic alluvial area of North India by the forest-covered, rocky and comparatively barren and\\ndry forestland, of central India, now called Madhya Pradesh. People from the Nor th, who have not\\ntraveled in south India, can have no idea of the beauty of the landscape, the fertility of the soil, and the\\nrich cultural background of the population of South India. Here the ancient hindu cultural, which has\\nlargely disappeared from North India, lies preserved in its pristine beauty. The ancient mountain\\nsystems of the Western and Eastern Ghats represent the most ancient mountain system of the world,\\ndating back to the beginning of life itself in the Archazoic period. It lacks the snow peaks and glaciers\\nof the Himalayas. These blue purple hills, studded with rich plantations of tea, coffee and rubber. In the\\nfoot hills areca palms are cultivated. As proceed towards the seacoast, coconut plantations, paddy,\\nplantains and sugarcane are being grown. The State of Kerala is known as the ‘ Land of the Coconut\\nPalm’ while Tamil Nadu can rightly be called the ‘Land of Palmyra Palm’. The Blue hills of the Eastern\\nGhats provide a heavenly contrast with emerald green of paddy fields, and in between them are rows\\nand rows of Palmyra palms with dark trunks bearing clusters of palmate leaves. The women carried out\\nmost of agriculture operations like transplanting of  paddy, weeding and hoeing, digging groundnut, or\\nscraping grass, etc. As compared with North India, the villages in South India are comparatively much\\ncleaner. The district of Coimbatore can claim to be one of the most progressive districts in India. The\\nAgricultural College, with its longstanding tradition of good research, has made a contribution to the\\nprogressive agriculture of this area. However, the credit mainly goes to the farmers themselves, the\\nNaidus and the Gounders, who are always ready to adopt some useful improvements. Agriculture in this\\ndistrict really represents the triumph of man over adverse circumstances and is hence all the more'),\n",

They dig tank—like wells, boring thr ough the hard rock to provide irrigation to their\\nfields the siphon system of irrigation with concrete towers for storage of water located in different parts\\nof their of their farms interconnected with under ground cement pipes enables them to irrigate land at\\ndifferent levels. Line sowing is common and application of green manures, tank mud, and fertilizers is\\nvery popular. Give a Naidu a barren piece of land, and by careful soil management he will convert. Most\\nof the well-to-do farmers are also industrialists who have set up small spinning mills. They not only\\ninvest the savings from industry in agriculture, but also apply techniques of industry in their farms,\\nwhich are run on commercial lines. Even small farmers have adopted a diversified system of agriculture\\ncombining cultivation of plantains, sugarcane and cotton with paddy. Glyricidia and Sesbania are\\ngrown as hedge plants in many farms. All operations in the culti vation of paddy can be seen going on\\nat the same time in the same village. While in one field nursery is being raised, in another transplanting\\nis being done, and in yet another harvesting is going on. This is on account of the tropical climate with\\nmore or less the same temperature all the year round. T he land being usually wet, the roads are\\ncommonly used for’ drying paddy and millets. As one travels in the districts of Madurai and Rama-\\nnathapuram, one can see paddy drying on the road with a woman keeping a watch. The passing vehicles\\nare usually careful not to trample over the drying grain. Leaving aside the huts of the landless labourers,\\nwhich are thatched with Palmyra leaves, the houses of the landowners are pucca, roofed with red tiles,\\nand usually white washed. Near the entrance of the village enormous images of horses are seen. These\\nare the ride of the guardian deity of the village known as Ayanar. Near some of the villages are\\nsometimes hundreds of baked clay images of horses; these are the offerings of the grateful villagers\\nwho have benefited from the grace of Ayanar who has saved the suffering bullock from disease, or a\\nchild from a serious malady. Scare-crows with ugly human races are also common in the fields. Apart\\nfrom saving the crop row herds and jackals, they  are also said to be efficacious against the evil eye of\\njealous neighbours. The most interesting festival in T amil Nadu is the festival of Pongal, when the\\nfarmers wash their cattle and decorate the horns of their bullocks. A crowd of villagers dressed in their\\nbest cloths proceeding in groups to the village temples. A distinctive feature of the landscape of Karnataka\\nis of with plantations of coconut and arecanut and numer ous irrigation tanks. The evergreen forests of\\nWestern Ghats in Karnataka have bamboos and coffee gardens. While the people of Mohenjodaro print\\nor carve their special breeds on their seals, the people of Karnataka built a gigantic memorial in honor\\nof the Nandi bull, the ride of Shiva. In t he famous temple of Halalebid, Krishna is shown playing the\\nflute while a herd of Hallikars breed with elongated pointed horns sur round Him spell bound by the\\nmusic of the flute. Andhra Pradesh is one of the young States of India. The Kammas and Reddys are\\nintelligent farmers who knew the use of fertilizers and line sowing long ago. Tobacco, chillies, turmeric\\nand groundnut are being cultivated on scientific lines adopting all the improved methods, which the\\nagricultural scientists are advocating. Their soil management is so good that by the application of green\\nmanures, organic manures and fertilizers. It is the Naidus and Reddies from Andhra area who migrated\\nin ancient times to Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu, and wherever they settled, they raised the level\\nof agriculture. One of their distinctive traits is sincerity and boldness with which they express their\\nviews. In fact, their frankness is really refreshing in this age of hypocrisy. The State of Kerala is unique\\nin India in its landscape as well as crops. The homes of the people even in the towns are surrounded by\\na patch of land in which coconut palms are grown as well as vegetables for home consumption. The red\\nsoil of Kerala and its vast plantation of coconut palms give it a distinctive character. Beautiful temples\\nand neatly built churches studded all over the countryside are a testimony of the culture of the people.\\nFarmers of Punjab are really the best farmers in India and were responsible for developing the colonies\\nin the canal-irrigated areas of West Punjab.'),\n",

If cultivators pay their taxes easily, they may be favourably supplied\\nwith grains, cattle, and money. The king shall bestow on cultivators only such favour and remission as\\nwell tend to swell the treasury, and shall avoid such as deplete it. He shall regard with fatherly kindness\\nthose who have passed the period of remission of taxes. He shall offer facilities for cattle breeding and\\ncommerce, construct roads for traffic both by land and water, and set up market towns. He shall also\\nconstruct reservoirs (sétu) filled with water either perennial or drawn from some other source. Whoever\\nstays away from any kind of cooperative construction (sambhúya setubhandhát) shall send his servants\\nand bullocks to carry on his work, shall have a sh are in the expenditure, but shall have no claim to the\\nprofit. The king shall exercise his right of o wnership with regard to fishing in reservoirs or lakes,\\nferrying and trading in vegetables. He shall protect agriculture from the molestation of oppressive fines,\\nfree labourer, and taxes; herds of cattle from thieves, tigers, poisonous creatures and cattle-disease. He\\nshall keep the herds of cattle from being destroyed by robbers. The king shall make provision for\\npasture grounds on uncultivable tracts.\\n(i) Advice to the Sage Kashyapa to the king - Kashyapa has repeatedly stressed the need for a\\ngenuine support to farm activities by the king or ruler concerned. In the modern context, this\\nwould mean support from the central and state governments. The ruler’s support is required in\\nidentifying land for agriculture, building wa ter reservoirs, planting trees on the banks of water\\nreservoirs, constructing canals and wells, water harvesting, making seed available, ensuring\\nsustenance to people, giving donation of land and subsidies to weaker people, arranging\\nmarkets, standardizing weights and measures, afforestation, locating mines producing metals\\nsuch as iron, copper, and zinc (brass?) gold, and silver and collecting taxes. Kashyapa has thus\\nstrongly suggested a very major role for the ruler (governments today) in fully supporting\\nvarious agricultural activities. He has emphasized that happiness all around can be felt only if\\nthere was food security. The king should appoint officers to search and acquire the best land who\\nknow the way to scrutinize the (quality of the land). Land selection is based on scientific\\nexamination of the soil. It is stated to be the king’s duty to get the entire land examined by\\nexperts and identify land that is good for agriculture,  is suitable for horticulture, should be of\\nconstructing permanent water reservoirs. T he location could be villages, other parts of the\\ncountry like towns or cities, mountains or the premises of forts and palaces. So long as good soil\\nand supply of water were assured any location was considered good. Especially in the rainy\\nseason, keeping a vigil on hundreds of canals (or trenches), wells, and lakes will be beneficial.\\nKing should take care on prevention of diseases and alleviation of danger from fire, guarantees\\nbest welfare, all round nourishment, and protection for both the bipeds and the quadrupeds.\\n2.4.6 Kautilya’s Arthasastra\\nI.

From the sun, the sprouting of the seeds\\ncan be inferred; from (the position of) the Jupiter, the formation of grains (stambakarita) can be\\ninferred; and from the movements of the V enus, rainfall can be inferred. When one-third of the\\nrequisite quantity of rain falls both during the commencement and closing months of the rainy\\nseason and two-thirds in the middle, then the rainfall is considered as very even.

Sangam was known as ‘Avaiyam’, Kudal or its variant ‘Kuttu’ before 700 A.D. In\\nPurananuru, the expression of ‘Kudal’ was used. Kudal was also used to indicate the Madurai city.\\nThirunavukarasar (Appar) in his ‘Tewaram’ had used the word, ‘Sangam’ while Thiruzhanasambandar\\nused the word ‘Togai’ means a collection. This showed that the institution was known as ‘Kudal’ or\\n‘Togai’ during Sangam period itself. Literature/poems is said to have been compared by the members\\nof that body of poets. A system of literary censorship was exercised in Tamil language during early days\\nof their literary history, which is known as ‘Avaiyam’ and not ‘Sangam’. There were three Tamil\\nSangam constituted one after another and were called\\n\\x7f First Sangam or Thalai Sangam;\\n\\x7f Middle Sangam or Idai Sangam and\\n\\x7f Last Sangam or Kadai Sangam.\\nThese periods was comprised of about 1000 years from 500 B.C to 500 A.D. as the extreme limits.\\nDravida Sangam in Madurai around fourth and fifth centur y was not a Tamil Sangam.\\n2.5.2 Tamil Literature—A bird’s View\\nThe Sangam literature provides very valuable information on the social, economic and political life of\\nthe people living in deltaic Tamil Nadu. Sanga kaalam is considered to be the Golden Age of Tamil\\nLiterature. The Ancient Sangam Age around 1000 B.C to 200 B.C was considered as the era of\\nTholkappiar. Tholkappiam is the oldest Tamil book. ‘Tolkappiyar’ whose age is generally placed in the\\n5th century B.C. gives us a lot of information for tracing the heritage of the Tamils. The land was treated\\nas five regions viz., mountains, forests, fields, coasts and deserts and the theme of love in five aspects\\nviz., union, patience, sulking, wailing and se paration. The poet dealing with a certain aspect of love\\nrestricted himself to a particular region, season, hour, flora and fauna. These literary conventions are\\nexplained in Tolkappiyam. The third Sangam period, the most notable is Tiruvalluvar’s Tirukkural or\\nKural, which deals with philosophy and wise maxims. It is the second great work with 1330 couplets\\n(133 topics each having 10 couplets). It has been translated into English and several other languages.\\nThe Late Sangam Age around 200 B.C. to 200 A.D. is considered as an era of Thiruvalluvar. The third\\noutstanding work in old Tamil is Silappathikaram around 200 A.D. as the era of Ilango. During the'),\n",

Then the capital and Sangam were shifted to Kapatapuram\\non the east coast. The sea too engulfed Ka patapuram. Then the capital and Sangam was shifted to the\\nMadurai, an inland city. Thus the present Madurai on the bank of river V aigai became the third capital\\nand the seat of Third Sangam of poets. There were references in Silapathigaram and in Kalithogai.\\n‘The Dark Age or the Kalabhra Interoregnum period witnesses the growth of Buddhism and Jainism\\nin the now shrinked Tamil country. The Kalabhra, of the Kannada soil, invasion during 250 A.D. alters\\nthe shape of Tamil literature and Tamil way of life. The post-Sangam period (200–600 A.D.) is notable\\nfor the composition of five great Tamil epics - Silappadikaram, Manimekalai, Jivaka-cintamani,\\nV alaiyapati and Kundalakesi. In 400 A.D., Ten Idylls (Pattuppattu) and the Eight Anthologies (Ettuttohai)\\nare classified into Akam or esoteric dealing with love and Puram or exoteric dealing with war. The\\nliterature of the third Sangam period mainly comprises of poems, which are arranged in eight antholo-\\ngies called Ettuttokoi and ten idylls called Pattuppa ttu. Ettuttokoi consists of Narrinai, Kuruntogai,\\nAinkurunuru, Padirruppattu, Paripadal, Kalittogai, Ahanuru and Purananuru. Pattuppattu consists\\nof Tirumurugarruppadai, Porunararruppadai, Cirupanarruppadai, Pattinappalai, Kurincippattu,\\nNedunalvadai, Maduraikkanci, Malaipadukadam, Mullaippattu and Perumpanarruppadai.\\nBakthi or The Pallava Period - The suppression of the alien Kalabhra clan by Pandiyan Kadumkon\\nby the end of the 6th century had helped a revival of the ancient orthodox religions of the land. Besides\\nthese, the Jain authors have produced five minor works—Yasodhara-kaviyam, Chulamani, Perunkathai,\\nNagakumara-kaviyamand, Nilakesi. Besides these, the Jain authors have produced five minor works—\\nYasodhara-kaviyam, Chulamani, Perunkathai, Nagakumara-kaviyam and Nilakesi. The Chola period or\\nthe Epic period: Kamba Ramayana in the 9th century A.D. Kamban, belonged to this period. He was\\nthe greatest of the court poets of Kulottunga Chola III (1178–1218 A.D.). He adapted V almiki’s Ramayana\\nin Tamil in his Ramakatai or Kamba Ramayanam. Another noble off spring of this period is Periapuranam.\\n(a) The age of Tamils ed Epic  - Between 600 and 900 A.D., the Tamil literature came under the\\ninfluence of Saiva and V aisnava saints called Nay anmars and Alvars respectively. The Saiva\\nsaints first compiled their hymns into the Devaram. The hymns of the Saiva saints were later\\ncollected into twelve anthologies called Tirumurais. The Periya Puranam or Tiruttondar Puranam,\\nconsidered as the twelfth Tirumurai, was composed by Sekkizhar (12th century A.D.). The\\nV aishnavaite saint Nathamuni (824–924 A.D.) compiled the Vaishnava hymns into four books\\ncalled Divya Prabandham or Nalayira Divya Prabandham. The other Alvar saints who contributed\\nto the Tamil religious literature include Periyali var, Poigaialvar, Bhutattalvar, Andal (the only\\nwoman saint among Alvars) and Nammalvar. Nammalvar’s Tiruvaymozhi, the third book of\\nDivya Prabandham, is said to be a quintessence of the Upanishads.\\n(b) Modern literature - The modern period witnessed the impact of Islam and Christianity on\\nTamil literature. Mohammedians rule during the 13th and 14th century. Umaruppulavar\\n(1605–1703 A.D.) was the earliest among the Muslim Tamil poets. He composed the\\nSirappuranam, which is a verse narra tive on the life of Prophet Muhammad. Another work\\ndealing with the Islamic faith was Muhaidin Puranam (1845 A.D.) by Mohammad Ibrahim.\\nConstanzio Beschi (1680–1747 A.D.), who adopted the pseudonym of ‘Viramamunivar’, wrote\\na classic Tembavani, on the life of Jesus Christ. Paramartta Gurukathai written by Viramamunivar\\nin the 18th century affords the earliest specimen in novel writing in Tamil. Subramanya Bharati\\n(1882–1921 A.D.) was one of the greatest of Tamil litterateurs of the modern times. He is\\nrenowned for his patriotic and devotional songs and intense prose writings on contemporary\\nsocial affairs. His ‘Panchali Sabadam’ is an epic poem based on a single episode of the\\nMahabharata.'),\n",

The Agriculturalists were called ‘ Ulavar’ and their\\nwomen the ‘Ulattiyar’ (Tolporul, 20). The classes of people owning land and the class of people actually\\ntilling the land were ‘Vellalas’ the farmer known as the superior ‘Vellalas’ and the latter known on\\ninferior ‘Vellalas. Ulavar was also known as V alnar. Ulutunbar or Yerin. Purananuru calls Ulavar as\\nKalamar. The term Ulavar itself indicates the use of the plough and the term V ellalar denotes the\\npropertiership of the soil. The cowherd comm unity counted the cattle as wealth while among agricul-\\nturalists the number of plough was the standard of measurement of wealth. A poet in Karuntogai speaks\\nof ‘Orerulavar’ a peasant with one ploughshare. Thiruvalluvar had highlighted the importance of\\nAgriculture in PART-104, Thirukural. Agriculture is considered as an esteemed profession (Kural, Chap\\n104). Valluvar had described the desirable feature of a territory or country. A country should have good\\nagriculturalists and learned and wealthy men. It must be free from hunger, disease, and enmity. A\\ncountry should not be under the influence of famine . In whatever occupation others might be engaged\\nthey might engaged, they must all depend finally on the fa rmer (Kural, 1031), even the ascetics will\\nbecome helpless if presents do not till the lands (Kural, 1036). Agriculture is not as dignified as other\\nprofessions; on the other hand, the agriculturalists are positi vely the support of whole world (Kural,\\n1032). Agriculturalists alone lead a truly useful life, the rest being only parasites and sycophants\\n(Kural, 1033). According to Thiruvalluvar an agriculturalist must: (i) plough the land; ( ii) manure it;\\n(iii) transplant the seedlings; ( iv) ensure an unfailing supply of channel water and (v ) protect the\\ncultivated farm from the stray cattle (Kural, 1038). He warns the farmer against lethargy, he lids him be\\nactive and never despond (Kural, 1040). The farmer is to guard against absentee-landlordism\\n(Kural, 1039).\\nA. Farmers, the Founders of Civilization\\nThiruvalluvar had high lightened the agriculture profession in PART 104 as follows: Behind the plough\\nin the whole world and is the prime of all prof essions (Kural 1031). Tillers of the soil are the axle-pin\\nof the revolving world because they sustain all others who have the plough and take to other occupations\\n(Kural, 1032). Farmers only live by right tha t till the soil and raise their own food, rest are parasites,\\nwho live upon them (Kural, 1033). The state of green fields, waving in fullness with sheaves of corn,\\nwill surely bring many countries around them under the influence (Kural, 1034). Trade increases the\\nwealth and glory of a country; but its real strength and stamina are to be looked for among the cultivators\\nof the land. The farmers, who eat only the fruits of their own toil, will never beg, nor will they deny alms\\nto a mendicant at their door (Kural, 1035). If the tillers of the soil withdraw their labour, even those who\\nhave renounced the world will lose their serenity and concentration of sprit (Kural, 1036). If the tillers\\nof the soil withdraw their labour, the householders support to the ascetics will naturally be affected and\\nloose their concentration (Kural, 42). If the ploughed soil is left to dry to a fourth of its bulk, there will\\nbe plenteous crop, without even a handful of manure being put in (Kural, 1037). V alluvar considers the\\npreparation of the soil as the first and foremost step while effective aeration and purposeful nitrogenisation\\nare incidental to it. Manuring is more important than ploughing, then, after proper weeding; plant\\nprotection is more important than water management. (Kural 1038). If the husband-man does not pay\\npersonal attention to his land like the neglected wife tha t field will turn it face away in loving anger.\\n(Kural, 1039). The good earth will laugh derisively at those, who pleading poverty, sit idle and neglect\\ntheir productive land.\\nB.

Rain bearing clouds under shrouding darkness with\\nlightning gives cool showers, the clouds that of a beating drum with short thick sticks and thunder again\\nand again gives heavy rains (Kurunthogai 270). Thiruvalluvar had stressed the need and importance of\\nrain not only for agriculture but also to the wealth and spiritual life of people in PART III of Thirukural.\\nV alluvar praised the rain as follows: As the falling rain sustains the world, it must be deemed as the\\nAmuta (the drink of immortal Gods) or the nectar of life (Kural, 11). From food come fourth begins,\\nfrom rain food is produced. All food is produced because of rain, which itself is food again (Kural, 12).\\nIf rain fail, hunger will cause infinite misery to the world, even though it is surrounded by the wide\\noceans (Kural, 13). If there is diminution in the bounty of rain, the ploughmen will be forced into\\nidleness (Kural, 14). Want of rain, spell ruin the prosperity, sufficiency of rain in farm, will lead to\\nrenewed prosperity. Even excess rain and cyclonic flood sometimes bring disaster (Kural, 15). If the\\nclouds do not shed drops of rain, even blades of grass cannot shoot up (Kural, 16). If the clouds\\nproduced by the sea fail in their bounty, even the wealth of the seas will shrink (Kural, 17). The pearl\\nformation would suffer due to the failure of rain in summer season. If rain failure occurs in October-\\nNovember, coral conception would be affected. If rain fails, there will be neither festivals nor rituals for\\nthe Gods themselves (Kural, 18). If heavens will not give up of their bounty to give rain to this world,\\nAlms to the needy and penance for the spiritual uplift cannot be sustained (Kural, 19). Even as life on\\nearth cannot sustain without water, Virtue too depends ultimately on rain (Kural, 20).\\nC. Seasons\\nSeasons were broadly classified into Ilavenil–(Chitrai–Vaigasi); Mudhuvenil–(Aani-Adi); Karkalam–\\n(Avani-Puratassi); Kuuthgirkalam–(Ipachi-Karthigai); Munpanikalam–(Marghali-Thai) and Pinpanikalam\\n–(Masi-Panguni). V engai flowers bloom with loosened petals and the fallen petals beautify the river\\nbed’s black sand locks in the spring (Early summer) season (Kalithogai, 32). The agriculture of the delta\\nfell into two divisions: a double crop and a single crop economy. The former consisted of growing a\\nshort crop of rice first, and a longer duration crop afterwards. The rice growing seasons of Tamil Nadu\\nvaries from region to region. The short crop in  turn, consisted of two varieties-a four months variety\\ncalled ‘Kar’ and a hundred days variety called ‘Kuruvai’. The former was confined to the first reaches\\nof the delta. Where the seedlings could be raised before the advent of the freshes and in reasonable\\nanticipation of its certainty, and the latter was the more common variety. The second crop grown on\\ndouble crop land was known as ‘Thaladi’, as distinguished from ‘Mudladi’ which was the first crop.\\nThe major crop economy, growing five months cr op called ‘Samba’. The first crop season was from\\nJune to October. The second crop October to February. The single crop season was spread over from\\nJune to January.\\nD.

Since Mullai land is located by the side or next to Kurinchi land, it is known as ‘Puravu’. The\\ncultivation of fruit trees and crops for cattle was undertaken in Mullai lands. Tholkappiar referred the\\nMullai land as ‘Kadurai Ulagam’ since the trees occur in predominant areas. It has grasslands on in\\nlarger areas. Growing sheep and weaving wool clothes was yet another profession.

Land Preparation\\nThiruvalluvar gives a few ideas about agricultural operations. If an agriculturalist would allow the\\nploughed land to dry up so that one todi (one palam) of dust dries down to one kashi (1/4 palam) i.e.,\\nif it is reduced to one fourth (1/4) of the original quantity, there will be no need to put into the land even\\none handful of eru, i.e., manure (Kural, 1037). Ploughing was carried out many times instead of single\\ntime (Ahananuru, 26:24-25). Agriculture can be practiced easily when the cultivator has his own ploughs,\\nIniyavainarpathu, 3:3). Ploughing one time was referred as Orusal ulavu; twice as Irusal ulavu and\\nmany times as Chensal ulavu. Plough the land deeper than wider. Cattle were used for ploughing.\\nCyperus weeds and crab cavities were destroyed during land preparation and levelled in wetlands\\n(Perumpanattrupadai). Crops had been raised in beds and channels (Nanmanikaddigai, 16).\\nG. Crops and Varieties\\nAncient Tamils cultivated paddy, black gram, horse gram, varagu, tenai, sesame, sugarcane, banana,\\ncoconut, palmgrab, bamboo grasses, jack fruit, tamarind and mango. V aragu was cultivated in Mullai\\nlands (Purananuru, 120). Tenai and field bean (Mochai) were cultivated as mixed crop in Kurinchi lands\\n(Kurunthogai, 72.240). Cotton and Tenai were cultivated as mixed crops (Kurunthogai, 72). Rice varieties\\nsuch as Chennel, V ennel, Salinel, Mudandainel, Ivananel, Kulanel, Thoppinel, Pudunel, V arnel, Aviananel,\\nTorainel were cultivated (Purananuru, Pattinapalai, Kurunthogai, 277). Mungil el or Mungil arisi obtained\\nfrom bamboo. It was taken as food at the time of king Pari (Purananuru, 109). Red gram, Black gram\\nwas cultivated in Marutham lands (Aaga nanuru, 339: Natrinai 28,  Purananuru, 297). Sugarcane was\\ncultivated with check basin Method at the foot hills (Kurunthogai, 262). Sugarcane var. Kalik karumbu\\nwas cultivated in Thagadur region during the king Adiyaman per iod (Purananuru, 99). Banana was\\ncultivated. Its terminal loft’s medicinal properties was mentioned in Kurunthogai, 308. Rice, sugarcane,\\ncoconut, plantains, areca palm, turmer ic, mango, palmyra, sembu ( Colocasia antiquolam) and ginger\\nwere grown in Cauvery river valley. A ‘Veli’ of land produced a round thousands kalams of paddy.\\nFarmer enjoys on seeing the first freshes and hearing the sound of Cauvery flow and of the eddying\\nwater scouring the bunds (Silappadikaram).\\nH. Seeds and Sowing\\nSeed was selected from those earheads that first matured. The selected seed was stored for sowing only\\nand never used as food grain. It was believed that such a diversion would destroy the family. Sowing\\ntenai seeds without ploughing was also practiced. Cyperus weeds were removed through feeding with\\npigs and then in such lands seeds were sown without ploughing (Purananuru, 168–6). Seeds were sown\\nwith adequate spacing (Narrinai). Seed germination happens with adequate moisture (Nanmanikadigai,\\n67).\\nI. Cropping Systems\\nCrop rotation was practiced by raising black gram (urd) after rice. They also practiced mixed cropping;\\ne.g., foxtail millet with lablab or cotton. Ginger and turmeric were grown as intercrops in coconut and\\njack fruit plantations. Rice fallow cultivation with other crops such as pulses had been reported in\\n‘Ingurunuru’. Cultivation of sugarcane was reported in ‘Pathittrupattu’. Mixed cropping of cotton and\\ntenai were also practiced. Pepper was grown as mixed crop in mango plantation (Inthinai, 8:1–2).\\nJ. Weed Management\\nWeeds were removed from the fields (Madurai kanchi). Tools were used for weed control (Ahananuru).\\nWeeds hamper the growth of crops (Nanmanikadigai).'),\n",

Soil Fertility\\nThiruvalluvar stated that fertile land alone is entitled to be called territory (Nadu) which yield wealth\\nunsought for (Kural, 739). The fertility of the land especially in Chola Kingdom finds proud mention\\nin contemporary literature. Organic manures were applied in ploughed lands (Narrinai). Avur Mulankilar\\nin a short poem addressed to Killivalavan says, “ The land is so fertile that a tiny piece there of, where\\na she-elephant might rest, can produce enough food to nourish seven bull elephants (Purananur, 40).\\nThe fertility of the land even in hilly areas like the Palakunrakottam (land between Tirupathi and\\nTiruvannamalai) was such that the sesame crop w as so healthy and full grown that a handful could\\ncontain no more than seven grains of sesame (Malaipadu, 102 to 106). Even without ploughing, merely\\nsowing deep in turned sod made mustard grown in great quantities (Malaipadu, 122 to 123). In a fairly\\nfertile farm, a veli of land produced a full thousand kalams of paddy (Porunnar, 246 to 248). The silt\\ncarried by the flood water w as a major source of fertilization, and the greater the volume of water, the\\ngreater the valuable silt deposit. Some of the more favourably situated fields were known as “Erikkattu”\\nmeaning tank reservoir. This was an ing enious system of “field insurance” against the risk of floods.\\nL. Irrigation Management\\nWater quality depends on land type (Nanmanikadigai, 80). Moisture stressed crops grow well on receipt\\nof rains (Iniyavainarpathu15:2); construction of ponds for others use is essential (Iniyavainarpathu1,\\n23:1).\\n(i) Art of well divining - The Cankam art works speak of the art of well-divining practice of the\\nTamils to wells on the highways for the weary travellers (Naririnai, 240; Purananuru, 306). The\\ndidactic work Tirikatukam (14) refers to the virtuous act of digging ‘drinking water wells’\\nbounteously. Tivakaram and Kayatara Nikantu refer to those well-versed in well-divining as\\n‘ulliyar’ and calliyar’ respectively. Although ‘Kuval, Acumpu, Kupam, Kuli, Puval, Keni, Turavu\\nare used synonymously to denote well, cankam classic speak of kuval only. Patirrupattu (51) and\\nAinkurunuru (203) revealed that the wells of those days, generally, were of shallow depth only.\\nAccording to two manuscr ipts, rocky lands were classed as ‘Kurinchi’; the land with coarse\\nsand, ‘Neytal’; the land abounding in scattered minor rocks, ‘Mullai’; muddy land, ‘Marutam’\\nand the unused tract ‘Palai’, of which the Neytal tract was su pposed to have moisture. The\\ndepths of the water source in different lands differed from the surface land. In Kurinchi springs\\nwill be found at a depth of 33 cans, in Palai 30 cans, in Mullai 36 cans, in Neytal 35 cans and\\nin Marutam 22 cans. The soil fit for the growth of banyan tree, tamarind, mango and so on might\\nhave water springs at different depths. The places where white rats, scorpion, the double-tongued\\nlizard, toad and so on inhabit might have water sources. Another manuscript talks about the\\nbrownishness of Mullai water, whiteness of Palai water, Kurinchi’s blackish water, Marutam’s\\npotable water and saltish water of Neytal. A w ell, which had disa ppeared due to human or\\nnatural calamities, can be traced on the basis of certain varieties of grass getting withered in\\nwinter and flourishing in summer season. In such places, there would be a swarm of flies and\\nants; also anthills appearing in places where certain grassy plants grow and such trees as ‘Vanci’\\nand ‘Nocci’ flourishing during the hot summer season, would be sure indications of the exist-\\nence of wells-now disappeared in such places.\\n(ii) Major irrigation system of ancient Tamil Nadu - In Purananur (18), Kudapula - Vianar says\\nthat a large irrigation system has relie ved the peasants from dependence on the monsoon. The\\nPallavas, whose capital was in Tondaimandalam, constructed several irrigation tanks, and\\npractically all of them are functioning to this day.

Seven anaicuts were constructed across\\nthe Tamiraparani. The exact dates when they were constructed are not known. The usual local\\nlegends have grown around each of them. That they are ancient, however is evident. They are in\\norder namely, Kodaimelalagiyan, Nadiyunni, Kannadiyan, Ariyanayakapuram, Palavur, Suttamalli,\\nand Marudur.\\n(iii) Tank systems - The Tamils constructed two types of tanks; large tanks, such as those referred\\nto in the early part of this paper, and innumerable smaller ones scattered all over the undulating\\ninterior of the Tamil country. Both kinds of tanks were largely looked after by the people\\nthemselves. The inscriptions in some of the tanks make mention of this responsibility. “The\\nprimary care of the village assemblies was to get the silt removed (Every year before the rains\\nset in) from the tanks under their control in time for them to secure the proper depth needed to\\nstore the full supply for the next year. Often special endowments were created or the penury of\\nvillage authorities. In some instances a cess called ‘Eriayan’ was collected from the villages for\\nthis purpose. The Cauvery system is very ancient is evident from Sangam literature. The Grand\\nAnicut, constructed by Karikalan in the first century is still in effective use.\\nM. Plant Protection\\nFencing had been laid out around the fields to protect from the animals. Fencing was done with bamboo\\n(Kurunthogai); Karuvel (Acacia sp.-in Ahananuru).\\nN. Harvesting and Threshing\\nHarvesting was carried out in night time with beating drums to protect from the wild animals (Kunthogai,\\n375;3; Madurai kanchi, 259-260); (Malaipattu, 471). Rice cr op was harvested using a tool ‘Kuyam’\\n(Narrinai, 195: 5–6). Rice was threshed using cattle and elephants (Malaipadukadam, Perunaruttrupaadai).\\nGarden land bean (Avarai) was cultivated in Tenai stubbles (Ingurunuru: 284:1-2); sowing of tenai and\\ncotton in harvested tenai lands (Malaipadukadam, 122–123).\\nA tool called ‘senyam’ was used for harvesting rice. Threshing of rice was done by hand with the\\nhelp of a buffalo (and in large holdings by elephants). Hand winnowing was done to remove chaff. One\\nsixth of the pr oduce was paid as tax to the king. Farm labourers were paid in kind. The land was\\nimmediately ploughed after harvest or water was allow ed to stagnate to facilitate rooting of stubble.\\nOperations requiring hard work such as ploughing were done by men while women attended to light\\nwork such as transplanting, weeding, bird scaring, harvesting and winnowing. In Kandapuranam, it is\\nmentioned that V alli, the daughter of a king, was sent for bird scaring in millet fields where Lord\\nMuruga (son of Lord Shiva) courted her and married.\\nO. Marketing\\nProducts were exchanged by weight. In Madurai (the headquarters of Sangam poets), there was a food\\ngrains bazaar where 18 kinds of cereals, millets, and pulses were sold. Each shop had a banner hoisted\\nhigh so that it cloud be seen fr om a distance indicating the grains sold. Customs duty was collected on\\nimports and exports.\\nRevenue from Agriculture: Tamil kings collected land tax, which was known as ‘irai’ or ‘karai’,\\ntolls and custom duties. Revenue collection was known as ‘ulgu’ and ‘sungam’. The duties paid by the\\nking (King’s share were known as ‘Kadamai’, ‘Paduvadu’ or ‘Padu’. ‘Vari’ was a generic term meaning\\nincome, i.e., revenue.

Revenue relief was given due to\\nunexpected poor harvests because of failure of rains. The poet Iraiyanar Ahapporul mentioned a long\\nperiod (twelve years) of failure in the Pandia kingdom. On such occasions of extreme famine, the\\nfarmer lived consuming the seeds normally intended fo r sowing.\\n2.5.3 Astronomy\\nThe path of the Sun being a fixed circle among the fixed stars is called ecliptic. The relative Sun moves\\nalong the ecliptic from West to East. To mark the movement of the sun, Moon and Planets, the ecliptic\\nis divided into 27 equal parts called “Nakshatras” (fixed stars) and also 12 equal parts called ‘Rashis’\\n(Signs). The time taken by the Sun to complete one round along the ecliptic is a fixed period, called\\nSidereal Year. The Sidereal year, Calendar year or Julian Y ear is made up to 365.2568 days and the\\nTropical year made up to 365.2422 days. There was excess 0.0078-day i.e., 3 days in 400 years. The\\nSidereal day is shorter than the apparent Solar Time by 4 minutes. The earth goes round the sun in 24\\nhours, but with reference to a Star, it goes round the sun within 23 hours and 56 minutes. Julius Caesar\\nintroduced the concept of leap year once in four years and was made equal to 365.25 days. Axis of\\nrotation causes the appearance of the sun oscillating slowly north south wards and south-north wards.\\nWhen the sun comes exactly above the equator twice a year one is called the beginning of V asantha\\n(spring) ruthu and the other, the beginning of Sharad (Autumn) ruthu. The Sun has another motion-\\nNorth to South and South to North. It crosses the East-West line twice a year. It goes 23½ to South-East\\nand 23 ½ North-East (Similarly of Western Zenith). But, the period between the two crossing of each\\npoint (From South to North and from North to South) is not always constant and the Sun does not cross\\nthe ecliptic at the same point. This is called Precession. In other words, the Period from one V ernal\\nEquinox to another V ernal Equinox may be called the Tropical Year. The duration of the ‘tropical year’\\nis accounted on the basis of the movement of the Earth around the Sun. In order to cover all the seasons,\\nits duration per year is 365.2422 days. The tropical calendar was spread to the different parts of the\\nworld by Sage V asishta and his brother sage Agast ya. That is why we find Sun temples all over the\\nworld.\\nDistance to be covered in the southernly direction is known as Dakshinaayana (summer solstice).\\nDakshina + Ayana it means the southern + latitudinal distance to be traversed. When the sun is in the\\nnorth, it is called, Dakshinaayana (summer solstice). Dakshinaayana (summer solstice) us of 6 months\\nduration tropically and so too is Uttaraayana (winter solstice). When the rays change their directions\\nand it will be found to do so either on June 21st or 22nd or December 21st or 22nd depending on\\nwhether it is Dakshiaayana (summer solstice) or Uttaraayana (winter solstice) respectively. Eqinoctical\\npoints are those on the orbits of the earth on which equal days and nights will appear and this happens\\ntwice a year on June 21st or 22nd or December 21st or 22nd.\\nA. The Zodiac\\nZodiac is the division of the heavens into twelve astr ology signs, each comprising exactly one-twelfth\\nof the heavenly circle or 30º and totalling 360º. The Zodiac is a circle of space surrounding the Earth.\\nIt may be imagined as a belt in the heavens about 15 degrees wide in which the planets travel. It is the\\nSun’s apparent path that is called ecliptic. The zodiacal circle is di vided into twelve parts, each part\\ncontaining thirty degrees of space called the signs of the Zodiac. Thus a sign is one twelfth division of\\nthe zodiacal circle and is defined as containing 30 degrees of celestial longitude: 12 signs each\\nmeasuring 30 degrees constitute the circle of the Zodiac or 360 degrees. In this circle the planets travel'),\n",

Adhaka is a measure of rainwater quantity in a land expanse of 100 yojanas in length and 30\\nyojanas in depth. The following formula will help to understand this concept clearly. 1 yojana\\n= 4 kroshas = 8 miles = 13 km. Hence ¼ yojana = 1 krosha = 3.2 km. If the rain water wets a land area\\nof approximately 100 yojanas (or 100 × 13 = 1300 km) in length and 30 yojanas (or 30 × 13 = 390 km)\\nin width (depth is interpreted as width), then it qualifies for an earthly measure of one adhaka. For\\nmeasurement of rainfall or rainwater the unit of rain-gauging was adhaka. An adhaka is the quantity of\\nrainfall which fills to the brim of a vessel 20 inches in diameter and 8 inches deep. Four such adhaka\\nconstitute one drona. The method of measurement of rainfall is described by V arahamihira in PART 23\\nentitled “Pravarshan Adhyaya” (PART on rainfall) of his book. A circular vessel with a diameter equal\\nto one (human) arm or the distance measured by the width of 20 (human) fingers and with a depth equal\\nto the distance measured by the width of (human) fingers and with a depth equal to the distance\\nmeasurement by the width of eight fingers should be accepted for measurement of rainfall. When this\\nvessel is completely filled with rainwater, the rainfall should be equal to 50 palas or one adhaka this\\nmethod has been explained by the seer Parashara. Parashara’s basic unit of measuring rainfall is adhaka.\\nOne drona = 4 adhakas = 6.4 cm.\\nAccording to Parashara the basic unit of rainfall is adhaka.\\n1 adhaka = 17600 ÷ 7 = 2514 cubic finger = ¼ drona  [eq 1]\\nV olume of the vessel = πr2d = 3.14 × 10 2 × 8 = 314 × 8 = 2512 cubic fingers [eq 2]\\nWhere π = 3.14, r = radius of the vessel = 10 fingers-width and d = depth of the vessel = 8 fingers-\\nwidth\\nThree units used to measure rainfall in ancient India were Pala, adhaka and drona (50 palas = 1\\nadhaka = ¼ drona). These ancient units can be related to the modern ones using the relation 2514 cubic\\nfingers of rainwater or 1 adhaka is equal in weight to 11 oz or 311.85 g. As 1 cc of water weighs 1 g,\\nso\\n1 adhaka = 2514 cubic fingers = 311.85 cc [eq 3]\\nIn a modern rain-gauge with a 200 cm 2 container, volume of 1 cm of rainwater collected is\\n200 cm × 1cm = 200 cc [eq 4]\\nBased on equation 3, rainfall measured using the ancient method could be related to modern units\\nas:\\n1 adhaka = 311.85 ÷ 200 = 1.6 cm [eq 5]\\n[i.e., volume of rainwater ÷ area of container = amount of rainwater collected (see equation 4)\\nFrom equations 1 and 5\\n1 drona = 4 adhaka = 6.4 cm [eq 6]\\n2. Parasara’s rainfall prediction - Every year has (a particular planet as) a ruler, (another planet\\nas) a minister, a particular cloud, and (depending on that) an amount of rainfall which one has to study\\nto acquire the knowledge of rains. The method of finding out the ruler (planet) of the year: Multiply the\\nnumber denoting the Saka year by three. Add two; divide the result by the number of sages (i.e., seven).\\nThe remainder is the number indicating the ruling planet of  that Saka year. The planet, which is fifth'),\n",

A model for forecasting seasonal rainfall recorded in Brhat Samhita - V arahamihira\\n(600 A.D.) evolved or adapted a technique based on science . This technique lays down that after the\\noccurrence of the full-moon day of the month of Jyestha (approximately coinciding with June of\\nGregorian calendar) the asterism or lunar mansion or naksatra of the day on which the first rainfall of\\nthat year rainy season is received should be noted. This asterism pr ovided the basic for the forecast of\\nseasonal rains. The predicted amount of the season’s total rainfall for each nakshatra or lunar mansion\\nif it happens to be the nakshatra on the first rainfall of the season is listed (Table 2.6). The first rainfall\\nof the season that occurred after the full-moon day of the month of Jyestha (approximately June) is\\ntaken into account for forecasting the seasonal rainfall, but the amount of rainfall recorded on that day\\nhas not been indicated. Modern meteorology defines a rainy day as a day on which a rainfall of 2.5 mm\\nor more has been recorded.\\n4. The method of ascertaining the type of cloud of the year - Add the types of fire (which is\\nthree) to the number denoting the Saka year.

When the Sun enters the sign of cancer while the moon is in Pisces,\\nAries, Taurus or Gemini, the rainfall is a hundred adhakas. If the sun passes through Leo and Sagittarius\\nit is half of that ( i.e., fifty adhakas). When the sun is in the Virgo or Leo rainfall is stated to be eighty\\nadhakas. When the Sun is in Cancer, Libra, Aquarius, the rainfall is said to be ninety-six adhakas.\\nFarming should be planned after studying the quantity of rainwater.\\n6. Sudden rainfall - If an expert on predictions of rainfall is approached with query regarding rains\\nwhile he is taking a dip in water or has water in his hand or is the variety of water, sudden rains can be\\npredicted. Ants emerging (from the ant hill) carrying their eggs and a sudden croaking of frogs are also\\nindications of sudden rains. Cats, mongooses, snakes, other creatures which live in holes as well as\\ngrasshoppers moving around freely as in a state of intoxication ar e also sure signs of sudden rains.\\nChildren playing on the road and building bridges of mud, and peacocks dancing also indicates sudden\\nrains without fail. People suffering from injury or vatadosha (human disorder similar to wind humor)\\ncomplaining of body pain and snakes climbing on the treetops also bespeak of sudden rains. Water birds\\ndrying their wings in the hot sun and crickets chirping in the sky also signify sudden rains.\\n7. Indications of famine - Mar’s transit through Dhruva (Uttaraphalguni, Uttarashadha and\\nUttarabhadrapada nakshadars), V aishanava ( Shravana), Hasta, Mula, Shakra (the master of Jyeshtha),\\nKritika, and Magha indicates famine.

When this vessel\\nwas filled with rainwater collected open space, rainfall was measured to be 50 palas or one adhaka or\\n¼ drona.

Continuous rains for\\nseven days, 80 days showering drops and sixty days intermittent showers alternating with sunshine\\nwere considered even and beneficial.\\nA. Varahamihira’s Brihat Samhita on Weather Forecast\\nIn Brihat Samhita, V arahamihira devotes eight parts to the science of forecasting rain. Weather forecast\\ncan be made with considerable accuracy only on the basis of observing process taking place in the Sun,\\nwhich in their turn, are correlated to certain planetary juxtapositions. Changes in the weather are\\nassociated with the Sun, the Moon and other planets under certain conditions of positions, either when\\nthey act alone or in combination. V arahamihira had dealt the sunspots and their effects on earth. Periods\\nof very heavy rainfall (flooding) also coincide with sunspot maxima. The appearance of these spots\\nwould bring thunderbolts, earthquakes and such unusual phenomena boding calamity. Every 11 years\\nor so there are great bursts of solar activity. During the maximum periods, there is an acceleration of\\nthe “earth’s heartbeats” causing a larger number of earthquakes. Sunspots also cause the eruption of\\nviolent winds releasing charged corpuscles, which cause terrestrial magnetic storms. Sun’s disc spot is\\nin the form of wedge, there will be famine. The solar wind is more ‘gusty’ around the time of maximum\\nsolar activity. When the Sun is more active, producing flares and spots, the solar wind contains more\\nhigh-speed streams. And these high-speed streams are ve ry likely to affect the weather on the earth.\\nDirects evidence linking sunspots and the weather comes from records of the occurrences of storms and\\nlightning. The annual lightning incidence (which is a measure of the number of lightning flashes\\noccurring in a given area each year) closely follows the mean sunspot index.\\nB. Principles of Astro-meteorology\\nThe Hindu astrological method of predicting rainfall a scientific method spread over a period of at least\\nsix months observation stage by stage. There is a need to study the garbhadharan (impregnation) of the\\nclouds towards the fag end of Dakshninayan (J uly 17 to January 13) on the particular day when the\\nmoon enters a particular constellation (or nakshatra) this should be done to predict rains during the\\nIndian monsoon. Similarly, for winter rains the garbha dharan is to be observed in the Uttarayana period\\n(January 14 to July 16). The following principles are being given for rainfall predictions:'),\n",

But by that time monsoon withdraws from the rest of northern India.\\n\\x7f When the sun enters Chitra, it continues to cause rain in Bihar particularly in north-east India.\\n\\x7f When the sun enters Swati. It causes some occasional rain otherwise the south-west monsoon\\nwithdraws totally, in Indian tradition there is reference to the bird called chatak which suppos-\\nedly waits for the rain-drop of swati.\\n\\x7f The moon, in certain positions, ‘nakshatras’ (constellations/star) joining, with other planets or\\nwhen inspected by them can cause or hinder rain.

Many tropical storms have whirled to hurricane intensity on the three days centered\\nat new Moon and full Moon. Heavy rain occurred most frequently about four days after full Moon and\\nreached a secondary peak about four days after new Moon. In other words the greatest amount of rain\\nfell when the Moon is either 45 or 225 degrees from sun. A clear correlation persists between the\\nmovements of the Moon and variations in quantities of rainfall. When a planet enters Cancer it well\\ninfluence the weather more in the northern hemisphere while the southern hemisphere is more\\ninfluenced when planets enter the sign Capricorn. Mars and dry weather: Coming to the planet Mars,\\nit raises the temperature, causing a dryness in the weather, especially when in Aries. Mars in conjunc-\\ntion with Jupiter exerts a disturbing effect on the weather, and storms of rain and thunder occur during\\nthe rainy season. Thunder, lightning and inundations are the outcome of Saturn-Mars influences.\\nWhen Mercury and V enus pass the Sun, usually wet and windily weather occurs. The position of\\nthe Sun at times of new Moon and season-changes will give the observer a clue as to the type of weather\\nlikely during a specified period of time. When Mercury and the Sun are in conjunction during the winter\\na blizzard or a cold wave occurs. When Mercury and the Sun are in superior conjunction followed by\\nMercury’s conjunction with or opposition to Mars, and Rahu conjuncts Sun, a fast moving cold wave\\nmay be brought about. Temperatures may fall rapidly. Mercury and Saturn in mutual aspect may keep\\nthe area of rising temperatures limited. An aspect of Venus can bring moist warm air and a promise of\\nmoderate to heavy rain or even storms or tornadoes. Venus retrogression or direct motion does not\\nsingly affect weather unless it is accompanied by other planets. A retrograde Jupiter is good for rains.\\nA retrograde Saturn is not beneficial for rains. How the winds are influenced: Mercury generates acute,\\nsharp and whipping winds; Venus generates sunny weather consistent with the season; Mars gives rise\\nto energetic watery winds and abnormally hot summers, and Saturn’s action is frequently related to\\nchronic cloudy skies and abnormal rainfall. Greatest numbers of fires observed at the time of the full\\nMoon. When the planet Jupiter is in perihelion there is a great drought and likewise when in aphelion\\nthere is more dampness and cold weather than usual.

In India, the classical Hindu astrological almanac is known as ‘Panchang’. Panchang\\nhas been prepared for public use from V edang Jyotish period 1400-1300 B.C. The word ‘Panchang’ has\\nderived from the Sanskrit words viz., ‘panch’ and ‘ang’, which mean ‘five’ and body part/limb’\\nrespectively. These parts are: (1) Tithi or lunar day; (2) V ara or week day; (3) Nakshatra or asterism or\\nconstellation; (4) Y oga or time during which the joint motion of the sun and the moon covers the space\\nof a nakshatra and (5) Karana or half of a lunar day or half-tithi.\\n(i) Tithi - The fifteenth day of the bright half is called Purnima, Paurnima, or Paurnamasi. It is\\ngenerally considered an auspicious day. The fifteenth day of the dark half is called Amavasya.\\nIt is called ‘Kuhu’ when the Moon is totally absent and ‘Sinivali’ when the moon is partially\\nabsent. It is generally considered an inauspicious day. The fourth, ninth, and the fourteenth days\\nare called ‘Rikta’, i.e., empty days and are not recommended for commencing any new project.\\n(ii) Vara - There are seven days in a week named after the seven principal ‘planets’ (old concept)\\nviz., Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, V enus and Saturn and they are believed generally to\\nposses the characteristics of the respective planets.\\n(iii) Nakshatra - Nakshatra are constellations of stars. There are twenty seven (or twenty eight) nakshatras\\nenumerated in a fixed order marking the Moon’s heavenly path. Each nakshatra is divided into four\\npadas, or charanas, i.e., quarters. Nine consecutive padas fall in one rashi, i.e., the zodiacal sign.\\n(iv) Rashi - Rashis are the twelve zodiacal signs that mark the imaginary or the apparent path of the\\nsun through space. e.g., Mesha (Aries) and Vrishaba (Taurus). The sun takes approximately one\\nmonth to pass through one sign (and takes thirteen to fourteen days to pass through one nakshatra).\\nA. Rain Forecasting in Indian Almanacs (Panchangs)\\nAccording to the Encyclopedia Britannica (1969), “An almanac is a book or table containing a calendar\\nof the days, weeks and months of the year , a register of ecclesiastical festivals and saint’s days and a\\nrecord of various astronomical phenomena, often with weather prognostications and seasonal sugges-\\ntions for the countrymen”. In India, the classical Hindu almanac is known as ‘Panchang’. It is a very\\nimportant book published yearly, and is the basic book of the society giving calenderical information\\non daily basis and is extensively used by the people all over India. For astrologers, it is one of basic\\nbooks for making astrological calculations, casting horoscopes, and for making predictions. For\\nfarmers, it is an astrological guide to start any farming activity. Hence, it is a fundamental book, which\\nis referred to by a large section of the people in this country for various purposes. The word ‘Panchang’\\nhas its roots in two Sanskrit words, viz., ‘panch’ and ‘ang’, which mean ‘five’ and ‘body part/limb’\\nrespectively. These parts are: (1) Tithi or lunar day - there are a total of thirty tithes in a lunar month,\\nfifteen in each fortnight; (2) V ara or week day - there are seven varas, namely, Ravivara (Sunday),\\nSomavara (Monday), Mangalavara (Tuesday), Budhavara (Wednesday), Guruvara (Thursday), Shukravara\\n(Friday), and Shanivara (Saturday); (3) Nakshatra or asterism or constellation - there are a total of\\ntwenty seven nakshtras named according to the yoga taras or identifying stars of each of the twenty\\nseven equal parts of the ecliptic or solar path; (4) Yoga or time during which the joint motion of the Sun\\nand the Moon covers the space of a nakshatra (there are twenty-seven yoga) and (5) Karana or half of\\na lunar day or half-tithi.\\n(a) Krishi-Panchang - Krishi-Panchang or Agro-almanac or Agro-panchang may be defined as\\n“basic astro-agricultural guide book/calendar published ann ually, giving calenderical information on\\nvarious aspects of agriculture and allied activities, basically suggesting region-wise, season-wise and\\ncrop-wise crop strategy based on astro-meteorological predictions, giving auspicious/inauspicious time\\nfor undertaking/avoiding various farm related operations, along with a list of performing religious rites,'),\n",

The Krishi-Panchang, being meant for meeting\\nagricultural purposes, majority of its contents should relate to agricultural information. In addition\\nto this, basic information such as annual date calendar, list of holidays, auspicious days/moments\\nof the coming year should be given for the benefit of farming communities.\\nThe contents of the proposed Krishi-Panchang can broadly be categorized in two major groups as\\nfollows:\\n1. Information, which changes every year\\n\\x7f Annual date and Holiday calendar\\n\\x7f Month-wise daily guide for the whole year\\n\\x7f“ Rashiphal”, i.e., month-wise forecasting of persons having different zodiac sings\\n\\x7f Daily/monthly/annual weather forecasting for the particular year\\n\\x7f Crop prospects of that year based on planetary positions\\n\\x7f Season-wise crop strategy based on anticipated weather\\n2. Information, which remains same irrespective of any particular year\\n\\x7f Theories relating to agricultural and meteorological forecasting\\n\\x7f Auspicious moments for agricultural and allied activities\\n\\x7f Some general agricultural guidance\\nIn ancient India, success in agricultural operations was determined from the position and\\nmovement of heavenly phenomena at the time of commencement of the particular practices. The ben-\\neficial or malefic influences were mostly v alued at the time of ploughing and sowing. On the basis of\\nposition of planets, nakshatras, and other celestial bodies at any particular moment, and their influence\\non both materials as well as non-materials, living as well as non-living, Hindu astrologers (Jyotishis or\\nHyotishacharyas ) have written several “ Muthurta Granthas ” (books on auspicious/inauspicious\\nmoments) for starting or doing or disregarding any activity (both agricultural as well as non-agricul-\\ntural). For example: For finding out auspicious moments/days for ploughing of farmlands, astrologers\\nconsider the “Hala Chakra” or “Ploughing Cycle”. According to the cycle, the three nakshatras ahead\\nof the nakshatra the sun leaves are inauspicious; three nakshatras ahead of those are auspicious; next\\nthree are inauspicious; next five are auspicious; next three are inauspicious; next five are auspicious;\\nnext three are inauspicious; and last three nakshatras are auspicious. This completes the cycle of 28\\nnakshatras (Ref: Muhurta Jy otish Vigyan; and Muhurta Chintaman ). In addition to the above, the\\n“Beejopti Chakra” or “Seed Cycle” should also be considered. According to the cycle, eight nakshatras\\nfrom the nakshatra at the position of the sun are inauspicious; in successive order next three nakshatras'),\n",

While preparing the Panchang,\\nthe editorial board members should keep in mind the following important points:\\n\\x7f The Krishi-Panchang is largely meant for the local fa rming comm unities, having very low\\neducational status. Hence, it must be in the local colloquial language to facilitate reading and\\ncomprehension.\\n\\x7f Care should be taken to make the Krishi-Panchang easily understandable and clear in its meaning.\\n\\x7f It should be very comprehensive in its content and coverage with proven predictive information\\nonly.\\n\\x7f It should not contain any astrological details or complexities, which would go beyond the under-\\nstanding capability of our less educated farmers and agriculturists.\\n\\x7f It should be attractive in colour, and presentation of information should be systematic according\\nto seasons ( Kharif, rabi, and summer) and crops.\\n\\x7f It must be low-priced/nominal-priced, within the affordable range of small and marginal\\nfarmers.\\n\\x7f More important is, it must be made available to the farmers and needy persons sufficiently in\\nadvance, i.e., at least 1–2 months before the start of the agriculture year (July-June).\\n2.7 METHODS OF RAINFALL FORECASTS\\nRainfall forecast is defined as “to tell before hand when, where and how it would rain”. For thousands\\nof years India has been using astrology, study of clouds, examination of winds, observations of nature,\\nanimals, plants, birds for medium and short-range forecasts after the examination of the trends of rain\\nastrologically for its overall long range forecasts.\\nShort range forecasts are forecasting monsoon rainfall developments, a few hours to 48 hours or\\n72 hours ahead.\\nMedium range forecasts are “preparation of scatter diagrams showing dispersal of rainfall classi-\\nfied as abnormal or normal or sub normal during the five-day period subsequent to the period to which\\nthe pressure height of a pair of selected stations refer”.\\nLong range forecasts are issued twice in the year for the entire period of four months June to\\nSeptember and later for the second half of the monsoon season August and September.\\nA. Artificial Rain-making Versus Yagna\\nArtificial rain making is the technique of making the already existing cloud cause rain. The ancient\\nIndian Vedic yagna technique is also used to cause rain. In the ‘Yagna’, the ash gases released through'),\n",

In the yagna experiment, the ash from the ingredients were\\nclaimed to have similar properties as the common salt used in seeding. Scientists do not believe seeding\\ncan be done without the presence of cloud first in tha t lies their difference with the yagna experiments\\nwhere it is claimed clouds are first formed and then seeded by nuclei in the ash. (In USA, Red-Indians\\ndo rain-making dances and bishops to sprinkle water on fields).\\nChemical cloud-seeding is a process for artificial rain-making destroying hail or making fog dis-\\nappear. The cloud seeding is done with the spray of sodium chloride or silver iodide over the clouds\\nthrough aero plane. Chemical cloud-seeding is of two-types-warm clouding and cold clouding. Warm\\nclouding is done in tropical country while cold cloud-seeding is done in hills such as Kerala. For cloud\\nseeding, there must be a good c loud with a thickness of at least one kilometer. The clouds contain\\nhygroscopic nuclei (water-vapour attracting particles) but the smaller nuclei travel faster than bigger\\nones. If bigger nuclei are introduced in the cloud, they will absorb the smaller nuc lei already present.\\nThe process of seeding is to “excite” the bigger nuclei already present and make them to grow at a\\nhigher speed so that they drop down as droplets of rain.\\nIn warm seeding, which is a process of coagulation, the cloud is seeded by common salt (NaCl)\\nalong with soapstone powder to prevent coagulation. The common salt nucleic are bigger than big\\nnuclei and are hygroscopic in nature so they  start precipitation and increase the efficiency of precipi-\\ntation in a cloud from the usual 10 percent to a much higher count. The increase is compared with\\ncontrol cloud and the growth can be observed through radar.\\nIn cold-seeding by a sublimating process, the cold cloud is already at a temperature below 0 o C.\\nEven in that state there are two nuclei, one in the ice state and the other in the water state at different\\npressures. The water nucleus, which is at higher pressure, goes over the ice nucleus. So here ice nucleus\\nis introduced by seeding with silver iodide in a liquid state.\\n2.8 CROPS\\nIndian agriculture is one of the oldest in the world and has millennia with involvement of farmers who\\nhave domesticated introduced and genetically enhanced a large number of species to harness maximum\\nproductivity. Farmers have preserved seeds along with associated knowledge over generations leading\\nto conservation. Archaeological findings have revealed that rice was a domesticated crop grown along\\nthe banks of the Ganges in the sixth millennium B.C. Later, it extended to other areas. Several species\\nof winter cereals viz., barley, oats and wheat and legumes such as Lentil and chickpea domesticated in\\nSouthwest Asia, were grown in Northwest India before the sixth millennium B.C. Some other millets,\\nsuch as sorghum, pearl millet and finger millet which were earlier domesticated in Africa, found their\\nway to the Indian subcontinent more than 4000 years ago. In addition, smaller millets such as the\\nspecies of Panicum, Setaria, Echinochloa, and Paspalum were domesticated in India since the Neolithic\\nperiod. Archaeological research also revealed cultivation of several other crops 3000 to 6000 years ago.\\nThese include oil seeds such as sesame, linseed, safflower, mustards and castor; legumes such as mung\\nbean, black gram, horse gram, pigeon pea, field pea, grass pea (khesari) and fenugreek; fibre crop such\\nas cotton (Gossypium spp.) and fruits such as jujube, grape, date, jackfruit, mango, mulberry and black\\nplum. Animals including livestock, sheep, goats, asses, dogs, pigs and horses were also domesticated.\\nThe primitive communities of the Neoliths period domesticated plants for food, legumes tubers fruits\\nfibres and luxury crops. A classification of the crops cultivated in the early parts of human history has\\nbeen given in Table 2.8.'),\n",

Remains of rice were found in the Y ung Shao exca-\\nvations in China, dating as far back as 2600 B.C. According to one writer, Julien, it was reserved for\\nthe Emperor of China to sow seed of rice at a particular ceremony (established about 2800 B.C.) in the\\nbeginning of the cultivation season, and the sowing of the less important kinds of grain was relegated\\nto the princes of his family. Archaeological excavation dated to 2300 B.C. at Lothal in Gujarat, a\\nsouthward extension of the Harappa and Mohen-jo-daro culture indicated the rice cultivation. Do\\nCondolle, affirms that rice had been a valued cr op in India since V edic times, though its cultivation in\\nthat sub continent might not be of the same antiquity as that of China. The archaeological rice sample\\nfrom India was from carbonized grains excavated from Hastinapur, north to Delhi and from Atrajnjikera\\nin Uttar Pradesh had revealed that rice was cultivated from 1500 to 700 B.C. One of the Indian names\\nof rice dhanya, for instance, means the supporter and nursery of mankind. Dhanya means ‘sustainer of\\nthe human race’ which indicates its age-old importance. V arious ceremonies in India include the use of\\ndhanya and the kernel tandula since it is regarded as an emblem of wealth, fortune, and prosperity. Rice\\nis a symbol of fertility and as such as originally used in China to pelt newly wed couples in order to\\nbring them good luck and assure them of many children. The Sanskrit word Urihi which most writers\\naccept as the most direct name for the grain in that language finds mention in Atharveda (1100 B.C.).\\nIt may be interesting to note that the name of rice ker nel is ‘arisi’ in Tamil language and the Arabian\\nname for it is alruzz, in the Spanish it is called arroz.

The names of some of the ancient kings of India were derived\\nfrom or associated with the word rice, thus about the sixth century B.C., the King of Nepal, father of\\nGautama Buddha, was known as Suddhodana, which means ‘pure rice’. The Sanskrit word for wild rice\\n‘neevara’ is also used in Telegu language for the wild rice, which invades the fields and waterways. Rice\\nspread eastward form India to China and then to Japan and westward into Iran, Iraq, Turkestan and\\nEgypt. According to Green historians, Alexander the Great (about 300 B.C.) carried rice from India\\nEurope and it went from there to Egypt and other countries in Africa. Large scale cultivation in Europe\\ndid not however begin till the close of the seventh century A.D. Because of the unsuitability of natural\\nconditions available there. From India rice went to Persia, Arabia and Turkestan where its cultivation\\nis still primitive, as they do not posses the right conditions for its culture.\\n2.11 HISTORY OF WHEAT CULTIVATION\\nAlthough wheat was introduced long before the Christian era, it attained its importance only after it. It\\nwas the chief food of the ‘mlechcha’ (non-believes in God), “the barbarians”, perhaps the Greeks and\\nthe people living outside India, and received the name ‘mlechcha-Bhojana’ (food for the non-believers).\\nIt was for a long time known as ‘Yavana’a kind of barley. A Greek writer has also mentioned about\\nwheat. Parasara, in Krishi-samgraha, speaks of wheat being a winter crop.\\n2.12 HISTORY OF SUGARCANE CULTIVATION\\nSugarcane was cultivated in India since prehistoric times and was an important crop there by the end\\nof the fourth century B.C. T he Rig V edic Aryans had the cane, and possibly the family name Ikshaku,\\nhad connection with large plantation. Apparently the cane was mostly chewed only and sometimes\\npressed and the juice used as drink. The idea of drying up the juice over fire came later, and the earliest\\nknown product was ‘gula’, or ‘guda’, a ball. In Bengal it is known as ‘bheri’ or ‘bheli’, from its form\\nresembling a kettle-drum. There was no attempt at crystallization. In course of time the next stage came,\\nwhen crystals were allowed to form, culminating in the production of ‘sitopala’, white crystals like rock\\ncrystals. A thoroughly scientific classification of the products of manufacture will be found in our\\nmedical works. It is also interesting to note that while only two varieties were known to Char aka, the\\nnumber had increased to twelve by the time Susruta came. Among the latter’s twelve there was one\\ncalled ‘tapasa’, evidently the wild ancestor of the modern forms. It is a remarkable fact that there is still\\na variety of cane known as ‘Uri akh’ in the north-west of Bengal which flowers. freely, and the culti-\\nvators use the seed for propagation, the adjective, ‘uri’ meaning wild, as in ‘Uridhan’. One of the twelve\\nvarieties of Susruta was ‘paundraka’, or ‘paundra’, the same as ‘paunda’ and ‘punri.’ of our cultivators,\\nundoubtedly the best of the indigenous canes. The commentators of Amarakosha tell us that the variety\\nis so named because it grew in the country called Punara, or Northern Bengal. It seems the country\\nderived its name from this fact just as the name Gauda from ‘guda’. The people who cultivated the cane\\nwere known as Paundras. During the invasion of India (327 B.C.) Alexander’s army found the local\\npeople obtaining ‘honey’ from reeds without the aid of bees. The methods of growing cane and making\\nsugar diffused east to Indo-china and west to Arabian countries and Europe. Kautilya noticed that the\\ncultivation of sugarcane involves trouble and expense. The difficulty was overcome by co-operation.\\nThe cultivators formed a ‘grantha’ or ‘knot’ or club among themselves both for the purpose of cultiva-\\ntion and manufacture of sugar. Co-operation was resorted to whenever the individual peasants were\\nunable to meet the wants separately. It is known as ‘ganta’ in Bengali, and is not at all a new idea\\nrecently introduced.

The original name was changed\\nduring its journey, to ‘Sukkar’ in Arabic, ‘Sakharon’ in Green, Sucre in French and finally to sugar in\\nEnglish. The next major event in the history of sugarcane was the importation of thick stemmed\\nvarieties of Saccharum officinarum from Thhiti to Jamaica in 1791 by Captain Bligh.\\n2.13 HISTORY OF COTTON CULTIVATION\\nGossypium herbaceum var. africanum may be regarded as a wild ancestor of the domesticated plants.\\nThe development of cotton textiles appears to have taken place, not in Africa, but in the Indus valley\\nin what is now Pakistan. Trade routes were opened between Africa and India at that time, and linted\\ncotton may well have been introduced to India as a curiosity, used first as a trimming or for embroidery\\non linen and woollen fabrics. The earliest known cotton fabrics in the Old World belong to the Indus\\ncivilization, indicating that the development of cotton as major new raw material took place in Sind.\\nExcavations in Mohen-jo-daro, Sind, Pakistan (Indus V alley) by Gulati and Turner (1928) revealed that\\noccurrence of cotton in the form of strings and fragment of cloth covering the household articles, which\\narchaeologists date to about 3000 B.C. The fragments discovered at Mohen-jo-daro were evidently\\nmade by competent craftsmen, and not by people experimenting clumsily with a new art, or with an\\nunfamiliar raw material. In all hair character istics that could be measured, the Mohen-jo-daro cotton\\nwas within the range of Indian cotton of the present day so it is certain that the major changes involved\\nin the evolution of lint were complete at that time. The existence of cotton threads has also been\\nmentioned in the Rig V eda the oldest scripture of the Hindus, written about 1500 B.C. and repeated\\nreferences of cotton utilization have been recorded in the ‘The sacred institute of Manu’ and ‘Asvalayana’\\n(800 B.C.). From India, cotton was introduced eastward to China and Westward to Egypt around\\nA.D. 600 but it was probably not cultivated there as a field crop for textile purposes until the thirteenth\\nor fourteenth century. Arab traders introduced cotton cultivation to the rest of African continent. It was\\nbrought to southern Europe (Sicily and Spain) by the Arab conquerors in the ninth and tenth centuries\\nA.D. The Greek and Roman civilizations depended largely on flax wool and silk. The inventions of the\\nautomatic power loom by Edmund Cartwright in 1785 in England and the cotton given by Eli Whitney\\nin 1793 in America revolutionized the cotton industry. Throughout the nineteenth century, cotton pro-\\nduction expanded steadily and now it is cultivated in all tropical, subtropical and warm temperature\\nparts of the world. Wool, silk and flax were used for spinning and weaving long before cotton became\\nimportant. Purseglove (1960, 1963) suggested that Gossypium herbaceum could have reached South\\nAmerica in Tertiary times via the Antarctic, retreating northward as glaciation advanced. Fryxell (1965)\\nshowed that cotton seeds can survive floating in sea water for at least a year with undiminished viability\\nand can thus be distributed by ocean currents. Purseglove (1968) agree that the most likely explanations\\nwere that cottonseeds floated across the Atlantic from Afr ica to South America.\\n2.14 CROP PRODUCTION IN ANCIENT INDIA\\nThe most probably earlier cultivation of crops was started on the foothills of upland areas of easily\\nworked soil and not in the valleys because development of agriculture in the valley implies water\\ncontrol which need more skill and r elatively more advance stage of technological development. This\\nhypothesis about the beginning of agriculture is the for ested foothills was put forward by Sauer - the\\nAmerican biographer.

Animal husbandry was dominant and crop raising was combined with livestock and trees.\\nThe economy of the country, according to Patanjali, depended upon agriculture and cattle breeding.\\nFarmers of the V edic period possessed a fair knowledge about soil fertility, selection of seeds, seasons\\nof sowing and harvesting and other practices including manu ring of fields. In ‘Arthashastra’ there is\\nmention about the suitability of different lands for cultivation of crops. Farmers of the Vedic period\\nknew the methods of improving soil fertility through rotation of crops. They planted deep rooting\\nplants, which served as natural aerators. Sweet potato was used to loosen the soil for the next crop. The\\nswelling roots of the crop acted like mild explosives. As an incentive to the farmer, sweet potato was\\nincluded in the diet specified for fasts, which indirectly helped in creating consumer demand for the\\ncrop. Most common rotations were of three years, which included deep rooted, shallow rooted and\\nlegume plants. These were wheat-chick pea; sugarcane-green manure crop; wheat-fallow; pigeon pea,\\nsorghum, etc. Mixed farming which included a combination of crops and livestock components was\\nalready in practice. Mixed cropping was the accepted system for raising crops. Legumes such as\\nchickpea and other pulses were often grown in combination with wheat in order to augment the nitro-\\ngen availability for wheat. Some of the important crop mixtures were sorghum + pigeon pea + cowpea;\\nblack gram or green gram (Mung bean) + sorghum or bajra; wheat + chickpea; and wheat + linseed. In\\ngeneral, monocropping was not the accepted practice.\\n2.14.1 Seasons\\nSix seasons mentioned in Rigveda are viz., Grishma (May-June), V arsha (July-August), Hemant\\n(September-October), Sharad (November-December), Shishir (January-February) and V asanta (March-\\nApril).

Kashyapa\\nhas mentioned taking a crop even in summer if water was available. He divided arable lands into two\\nmajor categories; viz., lands suitable for growing rice (paddy) and lands suitable for other crops. Basi-\\ncally low-lying lands, which could be irrigated easily, were meant for rice, whereas the uplands where\\nwater supply was limited were meant for the crops such as pulses. Rice fields were to be of higher\\nfertility than fields under other crops and were to be bunded to retain water but the bunds had to gave\\nopenings to allow excess water to flow elsewhere. Rice soils were to be clayey and rice fields close to\\neach other and to the threshing ground. Rice fields were always to have standing water. Kashyapa stated\\nthat fields for pulses, etc., were to be highlands and were considered of second quality. These crops\\nneeded less water.\\n2.16 LAND PREPARATION\\nIn Rigveda, farmers are stated to have resorted to repeated ploughings of land before sowing seeds.\\nClearly the purpose of such ploughings must have been to remove weeds, loosen the soil and pulverize\\nit to the extent required. Excavations made at Kalibangan, Rajasthan (India) revealed a ploughed field\\n(2450–2300 B.C.) that showed a grid of furrows, with North-South furrows 1.9 m apart and East-West\\nfurrows 30 cm apart. This pattern probably indicates the practice of mixed cropping. Practice of incor-\\nporating sesame as green manure before land preparation has already been mentioned in Varha Mihira’s\\nBrhat Samhita. There is a reference to heavy and light ploughs in V edic literature. These were probably\\nused for deep or shallow ploughing as required. Sage Parasara had stated that Anila i.e., Swati,\\nUttarashadha, Uttarabhardrapada, Uttarpahalguni, Rohini,  Mrigashirsha (Mriga), Mula, Punarvasu,\\nPushya, Shravana and Hasta are good stars for ploughing. Plowing on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday\\nand Friday results in good growth of crops. The second, third, fifth, seventh, tenth, eleventh, and\\nthirteenth, day of the month are good for ploughing. Ploughing should be commenced on auspicious\\nlagnas, such as Taurus (April 21), Pisces (February 20), Virgo (August 22), Gemini (May 21), Sagitta-\\nrius (November 23) and Scorpio (October 23). Lagna is the moment of the Sun’s entrance into the\\nrespective regions. Furrows should be single or in groups of three to five. Single furrows lead to\\nsuccess, in threes to wealth, and those in five  yield plenty of harvest. One plough gold in Hamanta\\n(December-January), silver and copper in V asanta (April-May) only crops in summer (June-July), but\\nin rainy season (August-September) one can plough only poverty.\\n2.17 SOIL AS A BASIC RESOURCE FOR SUCCESSFUL CROP\\nPRODUCTION (KASHYAPA)\\nKashyapa divided the agricultural land into two categories: shalibhu (=land fit for rice cultivation) and\\nadhakadibhu (=land suitable for cultivation of pulses and other grains). A good quality land yields good\\nresults to everyone, confers good health on the entir e family, and causes gro wth of money, cattle and\\ngrain. Thus the importance of a good soil can never be overemphasized. Kashyapa states that it is the\\nresponsibility of the king to appoint knowledgeable persons, regardless of their caste affiliation, to\\nscrutinize the suitability of land for growing cr ops. Kashyapa points out that a good soil should be\\ndevoid of bones and stones, should be a plastic clay with reddish and black hue, full of essence\\n(potency), and glossy with water, should not be too deep or shallow, should be conducive to speedy'),\n",

The use\\nof a disc 54 angulas in diameter (approx. 1 m) in place of ploughshare for using on hard virgin soil is\\nrecommended. The dates for ploughing operation are suggested on 20, February; 21, April; 21, May;\\n22, August; 23, October and 23, November.

Manure should be available and used for increasing the ‘potency’ of the land. Besides plow,\\nspades, lancets, small horns, (for breaking soils crust) knife, sickles, ropes, etc., were mentioned.\\nPloughing was to begin with the visibility of rain-bearing clouds and plots were to be filled with water\\nfor puddling to prepare for planting paddy. Kashyapa refe rs to worship of plough as well as bullocks.\\nFarm implements - Ancient literature of the subcontinent did not miss out on farm implements.\\nV edas describe a simple bullock drawn wooden plough, both light and heavy with an iron bar attached\\nas a plough share to open the soil. Krishi Parashara (c. 400 B.C.) (Sadhale, 1999) gives details of the\\ndesign of the plough with Sanskrit names for different parts. This basic design has hardly undergone\\nany change over centuries. Even today the resource poor farmers use a similar bullock drawn plough.\\nA bamboo stick of a specific size was used to measure land. Vedic literature and Krishi Parashara also\\nmention disc plough seed drill, blade harrow (Bakhar), wooden spike, root horrow, plankers, axe, hoe,\\nsickle, supa for winnowing, and a vessel to measure grain (udara). Pairs of bullocks used for ploughing\\nin ancient days varied from one to eight. Plough was considered as the most sacred and essential\\nimplement in agricultural operations and was known by different names. The more commonly known\\ndesi plough was a multipurpose implement.'),\n",

To procure healthy\\nseeds of panicles are located in the field, cut from the standing crop, and collected in a pouch. A mixture\\nof different kinds of seeds causes great loss.

Seeds of wheat,\\npulses, fruits, vegetables and condiments such as turmeric , cumin, black pepper, etc., also need to be\\npreserved for cultivation in the proper season. Kash yapa describes the procedure of preserving the\\nseeds and advises farmers to dry the seeds in the sun, store them in different kinds of vessels, and\\nprotect them from stormy rains and moisture as well as from rats, cats, and rabbits.\\n2.20 CROP DIVERSITY\\nIndia had a large and wide diversity in cereals, millets, pulses, oil seeds, fibres, vegetables and fruits.\\nThe species and varietal diversity provided wide  choices for selection according to soil type, climate\\nand management practice. A variety of rice, which was ready for harvest in sixty days, was available\\nin ancient India. Magadha grew another variety with large grains of extraordinary fragrance which was\\ncalled rice of grandes. Manasollasa referred to eight varieties of rice distinguished by their colour, odor,\\nsize and period of growth. India had five wild species of rice from which there had been a regular trend\\nof evolution from perennial to annual habit, from cr oss pollination to self-pollination and from lesser\\nto greater fecundity. Wheat recovered from Mohen-jo-daro belonged to Triticum vulgare, T. compactum\\nand T. sphaerococum. T. sphaerococum is a wheat of great antiquity (2300 B.C.) and was widely grown\\nin north India. It has high resistance to drought. Barley was cultivated throughout the Harappans period.\\nAryans were accustomed to barley diet. They adopted wheat and barley in the Indus valley culture and\\ngenerated new variability required for intensive cultivation. Millets such as sorghum, bajra and ragi\\nwere also important. They were primarily grown for grain but the straw was also regarded valuable as\\na cattle feed. About 25 species of sorghum were known to have been available. The use of ragi (Eleusine\\ncoracana) straw as a cattle feed was noticed in 1800 B .C. Pulses figured predominantly in crop rota-\\ntions and crop mixtures in the early period. Being legumes they maintained and improved fertility of\\nthe soil. Lentil, black gram, green gram and Lathyrus (Khesari) are pulses of antiquity and were noticed\\nin Narmada basin during 1657-1443 B.C. India is the original home of green gram. A wild variety of\\nVigna sublobata was found in Tarai forests. It was immune to yellow mosaic virus and was used in plant\\nbreeding. Black gram was widely accepted as a nutritious pulse crop in the ancient Indian culture since\\nthe V edic period. It was used in socio religious ceremonies and even today its importance has not\\nwaned. Similarly lentil also enriched the traditional diet. In oil seeds, sesamum was the most important\\ncrop grown by Harappans in the Indus valley. The Brassica group covering brown mustard, yellow\\nmustard and thoria is collectively known as Indian rape. The other important oil seeds comprised\\nlinseed and castor. Cotton cultivation was known to Harappans. Wild and weedy types of cotton have\\nbeen recorded from Gujarat, Kathiawar and Deccan. Th ey are perennial and known as tree cotton.\\nHarappans also knew date palm, pomegranate, lemon, coconut and melon. Babar (before 16th century)\\nmentioned in his memoirs the plants he saw in India. Th ey were mango, plantain, tamarind, mahuwa,\\njamun, chironji, khirni, ka ronda, ber, anola and orange.

Through a continuous process of selection and elimination, prom-\\nising plants or varieties were identified and their multiplication brought about by adopting diligent\\nmethods of seed collection, preservation and exchange within the social groups.\\n2.21 CHOICE OF CROPS AND VARIETIES\\nKashyapa listed rice and other cereals as the first, pulses and other grains as the second vegetables\\n(including fruits) the third, and creepers and flowers etc., the fourth. Kashyapa considered three main\\nvarieties of rice, Shali, Kalama, and Shastika. Shali rice is said to have twenty six varieties depending\\non the quality of land in different regions. Kalama is slightly thick white, and with a surplus sap.\\nShastika is tasteless. Vrihi is considered to be oldest name for rice. Shukla vrihi (white rice) mentioned\\nin Krishna Yajurveda (300 B.C.). In the same Veda Krishnanam vrihini (black rice), asunam vrihinam\\n(fast growing, 60 day rice), mahavrihinam (large seeded rice) and naivaram (wild rice) have been\\nmentioned. Atharvaveda, naivaram became nivara and in addition to black rice, red rice, and the 60-day\\nrice were mentioned. A new name for rice appeared in the Atharvaveda; i.e., tandula (for dehusked\\nrice). The word vrihi for rice was used in Upanishads. Shali was used for those rices, which were\\nplanted at the beginning of the rainy season and harvested in winter; these were probably the 6 month\\nvarieties. Vrihi, Shali, Nivara, Shastika as well as a new word Kalama appeared in Susruta Samhita\\n(400 B.C.) and Amarkosha of Amarsinha (200 A.D.).\\n2.22 RICE VARIETIES–OTHER ASPECTS\\nSome of the other highlights under the topic collection and preservation of seed are: ( i) it is the king’s\\ngovernment in today’s context (responsibility to ensure seed supply), ( ii) seed must be properly dried\\nin sun, (iii) giving a gift of seed is a superior act, (iv) different varieties of rice mature at different times\\ntaking 3 to 8 months, ( v) farmers should respect traditional knowledge of the region and use it,\\n(vi) Seeds of all kinds of other crops should be likewise collected , dried, and stored in pots, heaps, of\\nhusk or bowls and ( vii) seeds must be protected from rabbits, rats , cats, and moisture. Taking care of\\ngood seeds religiously is conducive to the benefit of farmers (as has been) said by great sages.\\nBasmati Rice: The word ‘basmati’ has its origin in the Sanskrit words ‘vaas’ means fragrance and\\n‘matup’ means possessing. Thus vaasmati should mean something possessing fragrance in northern\\nIndia, ‘va’ is often pronounced as ‘ba’ and thus the word ‘basmati’ should have been used for a kind or\\nrice having fragrance of scent.\\nGolden rice: Kashyapa had claimed that Peet varna vrihi (yellow rice) improved digestion or a\\nsambaka variety called Hema (golden rice).\\n2.23 SEQUENCE OF CROPPING\\nIn the Y ajurveda, distinct references to the rotation of crops are found. Cr ops were grown in the same\\nfield by rotation and the system of fallowing was also known (Rigveda). The Taittiriya Samhita dis-\\ntinctly mentions that in the course of a year, two crops were harvested from the same field. It also\\nmentions different seasons for ripening of different crops and the proper times for harvesting them. In\\na descriptive passage of the Rama yana sali, godhuma and yava ar e seen waiting for harvest with the\\nadvent of winter. But wheat and barley are winter or rabi crops sown in October and gathered at the end\\nof May. Kautilya gives directions for seasonable cultivation and harvesting.

Thus there were three crops-one sown in rainy season and\\ngarnered before Magha, another sown in autumn and garnered before Caitra and a third sown in spring\\nand stored by Jyaistha (cf. Barley “ripened in summer being sown in winter, rice ripened in autumn\\nbeing sown in the rains, while beans and sesamum ripened in winter and the cool season”. Arthasastra\\ncatalogues the crops of different seasons. Paddy, kodruva, sesamum, panic, daraka and varaka are sown\\nin the first season (purvavapah), mudga, masa and saivya are sown in the second season (madhyavapah),\\nkusumbha, lentil, kuluttha, barley, wheat, kalaya, linseed and mustard are sown in the last season. The\\nArtha sastra agree with kharif and rabi-crops respectively. The Milinda speaks as well of a third\\nmonsoon-(pavllssako) besides the regular rains of the later Summer and early winter. The three\\nmonsoons of course did not uniformly visit every part of the country each year; and whether a locality\\ngrew one or two or three crops depended on-rainfall, climatic conditions and character of the soil. In\\nmany places the food crops as well as edible fr uits and vegetables grew spontaneously without tillage.\\nTo the Greek observers these phenomena seemed strange. The description of the forest scenery in the\\nEpics (Ramayana; Mahabharata) and the Jatakas frequently go at length over the crops and fruits\\ngrowing in wild areas without human labour. In Arthasastra, it is stated that raising of a second crop by,\\nthe cultivators was sometimes made compulsory as a last resource for taxation. After a careful\\nobservation of the meteorological charts, it suggests the quantity of rain required by a specific crop and\\nthe cultivator is instructed f or the particular crop along the rain forests.\\nCrop rotation in Rigveda: Continuous cropping was a practice, but pulses (legumes) and other\\ncrops were also sown. “The cultivators harvesting the crops in general, separately and in due order” has\\nbeen interpreted to be giving an idea of crop-sequence or crop-rotation and line-sowing and avoiding\\noverlapping during harvest.\\n2.24 SEED AND SOWING\\nAncient scholars showed awareness of the importance of good seed; i.e., selection of the apparently\\nhealthy seed from a ripening crop, preserving it safely in storage, with or without treatments and sowing\\nthe good seed again with or without some treatment. About 2000 years ago, Parashara recommended\\n(i) proper drying of seed, (ii) freedom from the seeds of weeds, (iii) visual seed uniformity, (iv) storing\\nseeds in strong bags, and ( v) storing seed where white ants would not have access and at a location\\nwhere seed would not come in contact with substrates that would allow moulds to grow such as\\ncowshed wastes, damp spots, or left over foods. Sage Parasara had stated that Uttrashadha, Uttarashadha,\\nUttarabhardrapada, Uttarpahalguni, Mula, Jeyshtha, Anuratha,  Magha, Rohini, Mrigashirsha (Mriga),\\nRohini, Hasta, and Revathi are the good nakshatras for sowing. Two days should be avoided for sowing,\\ntransplanting; Tuesday, which portends threat from rats and Saturday, which foretells threat from\\nlocusts and insects. Sowing should not be done on  ‘empty’ days (such as the fourth, ninth, and the\\nfourteenth day of the lunar fortnight of a month) especially if the moon is weak. Seeds of grains should\\nbe planted at a distance of hand (approximately 1½ ft =45 cm) when the sun is in Cancer. In Leo the\\ndistance should be half of it. In Virgo it should be four fingers, (3–4 inches =7.6 –10.2 cm). Butter milk\\nmakes the seeds sprout earlier than the normal time. Salt would kill the embryo. Kautilya in Artha\\nSastra indicated that decision to sow seeds of specific crops should be taken on the basis of known\\nrainfall patterns. He recommended that rice be sown first and mung bean and black gram later. He also\\nsuggested some seed treatments. ( e.g., cow dung, honey and ghee) to ensure good germination. Manu\\nmentioned that a professional farmer (the Vysya) must be ab le to determine the quality of seed. The'),\n",

The\\nprocedure is said to depend on the characteristics of land, availability of water, sunshine, and also on\\nadditional wisdom. Varahamihira recommended pelleting of seed  with flours of rice, black gram and\\nsesame and fumigating them with turmeric powder to ensure good germination. Surapala listed several\\nbotanicals such as seed treatment materials for shrubs and trees. Even today cow dung, suggested by\\nKautilya in the 4th century B.C., is used for treating cotton and some other seeds by a large number of\\nfarmers. Sowing of seed was considered a very important event. Prayers and rituals were associated\\nwith the sowing operation. Primitive bamboo drills were used for sowing seed. Adjusting the inter-plant\\nand inter-row spacing was done on the basis of sowing time; late sowing meant more seeds per unit\\nurea. A wooden plank was run over sown fields to ensure uniform seed germination. The art of sowing\\nrice in small areas; i.e., in nurseries and transplanting of the seedlings is not a recent practice. It was first\\nperfected in the deltas of Godavari and Krishna rivers in 100 A.D.\\nThe general practice of sowing seeds, according to Varahamihira, involved soaking them in milk\\nfor ten days, taking out daily with hand, smearing with ghee, rolling many times in cow dung and\\nfumigating with the flesh of deer or hog. Then the seeds were sown in a soil which was already treated\\nwith sesamum crushed together with flesh and hog’s marrow. They grew and bloomed when sprinkled\\nwith milk and water. Another method was to soak the seeds hundred times in a paste of Ankola\\n(Alangium salvifolium Wang) fruiter in its oil or in a paste or oil of Slesmataka (Cordiarothii Roem and\\nSchult) fruit and sow in a soil mixed with hail. The seeds would sprout instantly and bear fruits. Hard\\nseeds like tamarind sprouted when sprinkled with a mixture of the flour of rice, black gram and\\nsesamum and wheat particles together with stale meat, and fumigated with turmeric powder, repeatedly.\\nFor Slesmataka the shell of the seeds was remo ved, then soaked in water, mixed with the paste of\\nAlangium fruits and dried in the shade seven times, mixed with buffalo dung and stored in the dry dung.\\nThe seeds were then sown in a soil soaked with rain water. The bearing was good.\\nSeeds were treated in a special manner to get special results. Cotton seed was treated with red lac\\njuice in a special manner to get red tinged cotton. It was also treated with cow dung paste to facilitate\\nsowing and control of seed borne diseases. The seedlings for transplanting at a distant place were\\nsmeared from root up to the stem with a mixture of ghee, Usira or Khas (V etiveria zizanioides), sesamum,\\nhoney, Vidanga (Emblica ribes), milk and cow-dung. Sali paddy was grown by transplanting (Kalidas\\nin Raghuvamsha). Incidentally, the technique of transplanting rice was widely practice in\\nKrishna-Godavari deltas in 100 A.D. It was the most important agricultural operation during the Sangam\\nage (A.D. 300–600). V arahamihira has recorded two methods of grafting. They are: ( i) inserting the\\ncutting of a plant into the root of another, cut off from its trunk, and (ii ) inserting the cutting of a tree\\ninto the stem of another. The junction of the two in both the cases was covered with a coating of mud\\nand cow dung. Grafting was advocated for jackfruit, ashoka, plantain, rose apple, lemon, pomegranate,\\ngrape, jasmine, etc. Further, he recommended February-March for grafting those plants which\\nhave not developed branching; December-January f or those which have developed branching and\\nAugust-September for those which have developed large branches. The grafted trees were to be watered\\nboth in the morning and evening every day in summer, on alternate days in the cold season and\\nwhenever the soil becomes dry in the rainy season.\\nKashyapa’s view on rice cultivation: Rice is divided by experts into three main varieties based on\\ntheir taste and colour; shali, kalama and shastika. The golden rice sambaka vrihi (rice) var hema and\\npeetavarna vrihi (yellow rice), which removes indigestion. Kalama of red colour, kalama of thick form,'),\n",

Kashyapa for the first time has recommended trans-\\nplanting of rice in ancient literature .\\n2.25 WEEDS AND WEEDING\\nThe role of weeds in reducing crop yields was well understood by our ancestors. Parashara pointed out\\nthe need to weed rice fields; as many as four weedings were suggested. Weeding as an essential practice\\nin raising crops is stated in the Sangam literature. Parashara recommends collection of crop seeds free\\nof weed seeds.\\n2.26  NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT\\nKashyapa emphasized that the Brahmins proficient in V edas should sprinkle the fivefold cow-products\\n(milk, curd, ghee [clarified butter], urine, and dung) or may be simply sprinkle with clean water over\\nthe land (for the purpose of purifying the atmosphere) either in the morning or in the evening. This is\\nknown as ‘Panchakowia’.\\n2.27  WATER MANAGEMENT\\nSage Parasara: Construction of bunds to retain water in plots is recommended to rice. Bunding has not\\nbeen recommended in low-level fields since there would be adequate moisture. Direct seeding of rice\\nhas been recommended for low-lying areas. Avoid flooding of rice once the panicles have come out,\\nhowever the soil must remain moist.\\nKashyapa was supportive of irrigated crop production: Kashyapa focused his attention on\\nirrigated agriculture. Construction of wells and device for lifting water had been described. Kashyapa\\nhas given details about where how water reservoirs should be constructed. He stressed construction of\\na reservoir near farmers’ fields, ensuring source of water for the reservoir, making strong causeways and\\nthus taking steps to avoid flooding of inhabited areas, and regularly inspecting and repairing the reser-\\nvoirs, especially during the rainy season. The last one is good reminder to present day, lazy, and\\nindifferent staff of the government irrigation departments. Each farmer should have access to two\\nreservoirs. Kashyapa’s recommendations on buildings and maintenance of reservoirs are technically\\nsound. Kashyapa recommended planting of trees around water reservoirs obviously to protect and\\nbeautify them. He suggested picnic spots around reservoirs, a feature that is considered ‘modern’ in the\\n21st century. Construction of canals has been indicated in verses 111 through 143 of section I. Kashyapa\\nhas mentioned four sources of canal. (i) river, (ii) tank, which could have been filled by a river, (iii) large\\nlake, and (iv) canals collecting water from mountain cascades. Kashyapa has stressed provision of a proper\\ngradient for the canals and a network of these canals surrounding villages. He emphasized selection of soil\\nwith right structure and profile for making canals and avoiding saline soils. Protection of the canal system,\\nlike the protection of reservoirs was also stressed. Kashyapa recommended construction of wells, especially\\nin areas where canal water was not available. Best time for digging wells was the post rainy season. He\\nsuggested study of indicators for the presence of sub soil water such as existence of trees and course, water'),\n",

Kasyapa has mentioned the use of ghatiyantra (the so-\\ncalled Persian wheel) with the help of bullocks, elephants, and humans. Harvesting of rain was stressed. A\\nverse that says everything about water for farming is “it may be a canal, a well, a pool, or a lake, but find\\nthey must and acquire a guaranteed source of water.”\\n2.28  NEW CROPS AND OTHER PLANTS\\nPortuguese introduced new crops and fruit plants during the sixteenth century and enriched the agricul-\\nture of India. They were the greatest benefactors of India. Babar introduced the scented Persian rose.\\nSimilarly the botanical garden of Calcutta has performed a very useful function by introducing many\\nimportant new plants. Following are some of the crops and plants which were introduced by Portuguese\\nfrom Brazil, Chile, Peru and Mexico. These crops and trees now form important components of the\\ncommon cropping systems followed in the country.\\n(a)  Crops\\n\\x7f Groundnut (Peanut) - main source of edible oil in India. A native of Brazil.\\n\\x7f Tobacco - introduced by Portuguese during the reign of Emperor Akbar.\\n\\x7f Potato - widely accepted and grown in India as a favourite vegetable. It is a native of C hille and\\nPeru.\\n\\x7f Amaranth - the colourful crop is grown along the whole length of Himalayas. It is a native of\\nBrazil.\\n\\x7f Chillies - the ornament of Indian garden and soul of pic kles. It is a native of Brazil and Peru.\\n\\x7f Agave - a century plant and has become acclimatized throughout India.\\n\\x7f Allamanda (Allamanda cathartica L. Mant) - a climber with beautiful flowers. It is a native of\\nBrazil and South America.\\n(b)  Fruits\\n\\x7f Cashew nut - widely grown in India and a native of Brazil.\\n\\x7f Guava - common fruit crop of India. It grows wild in Brazil.\\n\\x7f Custard apple - widely grown as a forest crop. Introduced by Portuguese.\\n\\x7f Sapota - a gift from Portuguese. Delicious fruit and native of Mexico.\\n\\x7f Pineapple - extensively grown in eastern parts of India. It is indigenous to Brazil. Indian people\\nevinced keen interest in the introduced crops and gave a fair trial under close observation. This\\nresulted in the spread of the selected crops throughout India.\\n2.29 GROWTH PROMOTERS\\nIn respect of diseases, Varahamihira says the tree catches disease from cold weather, strong winds and\\nhot sun. In such cases a paste made of vidanga, ghee and silt must be applied to the affected parts. Water\\nand milk should be sprinkled on such trees. When there is a premature fruit drop, the tree should be\\nwatered with milk that has been cooled after being boil ed with horse gram, black gram, green gram,\\nsesamum and barley. After this treatment, the trees will produce abundant flowers and fruits. A mixture\\nof powdered dung of goats and sheep, sesamum powder, wheat articles, beef and water, kept for seven\\nnights should be sprinkled for increasing flowers and fruits of trees, creepers and shrubs. In the Sangam\\nage, the dung of cow and sheep and green leaves were used to increase the yield of crops. Krishi'),\n",

It is equal\\nto one fourth drona. Measuring the grains from the right leads to expenditure whereas from the left\\nleads to happiness and enhancement of yield.\\nMeasurement of crop produce (Kashyapa): He should also make arrangements of prastha, kunja,\\ndrona, and small nadika for (proper) measurement of grains of cereals and adhaka (pigeonpea) etc., and\\nother commodities. The first three are the measures of capacity, prastha = ¼ adhaka; drona = 4 adhakas,\\nkunja–should have been kunchi = 1/32 adhaka, where one adhaka = 256 fistfuls = 32 kunchis, i.e., 32\\nhandfuls, nadika is a measure of length = 2 hastas,  where one hasta is the distance between the elbow\\nand the tip of the middle finger and is appr oximately equal to 18 inches.

He also advises the farmers to take up second\\ncultivation every year. This is said to be particularly beneficial on a fertile land with sufficient water\\nsupply throughout the year.\\n2.33 SOIL CLASSIFICATION\\nPhysically, India may be divided more or less into three main regions viz., (1) the mountainous borders\\nof Himalayas in the north and of the Vindhyas in the south with the linings of Ghats in the south-eastern\\nand south-western coasts and the traverse range or Aravalli hills; (2) the Deccan plateau or table land;\\nand (3) the plains or low-lands, a rich Indo-Gangetic alluvium over flown by the rivers–the Ganges,\\nJamuna and Brahmaputra. Although primordial mountains remained inaccessible for human settlement,\\nthe foothills have been increasingly brought under cultivation and settlement and the upland valleys\\nstriking the Himalayas include some or the most fertile of Indian lowland formations. The whole Indo-\\nGangetic alluvium consists of rich fertile soil and has contributed materially to the growth of civilization.\\n(i) The Himalayas - The Himalayas (Sanskrit: hima, ‘snow’ and alaya, ‘abode’), the loftiest moun-\\ntain system in the world, form the northern limit of India. This great, geologically young moun-\\ntain arc is about 1,550 miles (2,500 km) long , stretching from the peak of Nanga Parbat in\\nPakistan-held Jammu and Kashmir to the Namcha Barwa peak in the Tibet Autonomous Region\\nof China. Between these extremes the mountains fall acr oss India, southern Tibet, Nepal, and\\nBhutan. The width of the system varies between 125 and 250 miles.\\n(ii) The Indo-Gangetic Plain - The second great structural component of India, the Indo-Gangetic\\nPlain (also called the North Indian Plain), lies between the Himalayas and the Deccan. The plain\\noccupies the Himalayan fore deep, formerly a seabed but now filled with river-borne alluvium\\nto depths of up to 6,000 feet. The plain stretches from the Pakistani provinces of Sind and Punjab\\nin the west, where it is watered by the Indus and its tributaries, eastward to the Brahmaputra\\nvalley in Assam. The Ganges basin (mainly in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) forms the central and\\nprincipal part of this plain. The eastern part is made up of the combined delta of the Ganges and\\nBrahmaputra rivers, which, though mainly in Bangladesh, also occupies a part of the adjacent\\nIndian state of West Bengal. This deltaic area is char acterized by annual flooding attributed to\\nintense monsoon rainfall, an e xceedingly gentle gradient, and an enormous discharge that the\\nalluvium-choked rivers cannot contain within their channels. The Indus River basin, extending\\nwest from Delhi, forms the western part of the plain; the Indian portion is mainly in the states\\nof Haryana and Punjab.

The vast knowledge acquired by experience has been\\nhanded over from generation to generation.\\n2.34 SOIL TYPES OF INDIA\\nThe investigations of V oelcker in 1893, and those of Leather in 1898, led to a classification if India soils\\ninto four major types and three minor types: ( i) the Indo-Gangetic alluvium; (ii) the black cotton soils;\\n(iii) the red soils lying on metamorphic rocks; and ( iv) the lateritic soils.\\n(i) Indo-Gengetic alluvium - The Indo-Gangetic alluvium is by far the largest and most important\\nof the soil groups of India. The soils of this group cover about 777,000 square kilometers. They\\nare distributed mainly the Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal and parts of Assam and\\nOrissa. They produce bumber crops of wheat and rice. Geologically the alluvium is divided into:\\n(i) Khadar, or new alluvium of sandy composition, generally light in colour, about 10,000 years\\nold, and (ii ) Bhangar, or the older alluvium of Pleistocene elate, of more clayey composition,\\ngenerally of dark colour, and fun of pebbles or kankar. The soils differ in consistency from drift\\nsand to loams, and from fine silts to stilts clays. A few pebble beds are also occasionally met\\nwith. The presence of impervious clays obstructs the drainage, and also pr omotes the accumu-\\nlation of injurious salts of sodium arid magnesium, which make the soils sterile. The formation\\nof hard pans at certain levels in the soil profile as a result of the binding of soil grains by the\\ninfiltrating silica or calcareous matter is often observed in these alluvial soils. A majority of the\\nsoils are loams or sandy loams, with a soil crust of varying depth. Soluble salts are present in\\nconsiderable quantities.\\nThe alluvial soils of Tamil Nadu are transported soils, found mainly in the deltaic areas and on\\nthe coastal line, A section of the profile shows alternate layers of sand and silt. The composition\\nof the strata varies with the nature of the silt brought by the rivers which, in turn, varies with the\\ncatchment areas and the tracts through which the streams flow.\\n(ii) Black cotton soils - The typical soil of the Deccan Trap is the regur or black cotton soil. It is\\ncommon in Maharashtra, in the western parts of Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and ‘some parts\\nof Tamil Nadu, including the districts of Ramnad and Tirunelvely in the extreme south. It is\\ncomparable with the chernozems of Russia and with the prairie soil of the cotton-growing tracts\\nof the United States of America, especially the black adobe of California. It is derived from two\\ntypes of rocks: the Deccan and Rajmahal Trap, and the ferruginous gneisses and schists occur-\\nring in Tamil Nadu under semi-arid conditions. The former attains sometimes considerable\\ndepths, whereas the latter ar e generally shallow. The black soil areas have, generally, a high\\ndegree of fertility, though some mainly in the uplands are of low productivity. The soils on the\\nslopes and the uplands are somewhat sandy, but those in the broken country between the hills\\nand the plains are darker, deeper and richer, and are constantly enriched by deposits washed\\ndown from the hills.\\n(iii) Red soils - Red soils extend practically over the whole Archaean basement of Peninsular India,\\nfrom Bundelkhand to the extreme south, covering 2,072,000 square km, embracing south\\nBengal, Orissa, parts of Madhya Pradesh eastern Andhra Pradesh Karnataka, and a major part of\\nTamil Nadu. These soils also occur in Santhal Parganas in Bihar, and in the Mirzapur, Jhansi and\\nHamirpur districts of Uttar Pradesh. They were produced as a result to meteoric weathering of'),\n",

These soils started developing around the Mesozoic\\nand Tertiary ages. The colour if these soils is generally red, grading sometimes into brown\\nchocolate, yellow; grey and even black. The redness is due more to a general diffusion than to\\na high proportion of iron content. The soils grade from the poor thin gravelly and light coloured\\nvarieties of the uplands to the much more fertile deep dark varieties of the plains and the valleys.\\nThey are generally; poor in nitrogen phosphorus and humus. Compared with regur, they are poor\\nin lime, potash and iron oxide, and are also uniformly low in phosphorus. The clay fraction of\\nthe soils is rich in kaolinite. More than two-thirds of the cultivated area in Tamil Nadu is covered\\nby red soils they are in-situ formations produced from the rock below under the influence of\\nclimatic conditions. The rocks are acidic, consisting of mica or red granites. The soils are\\nshallow and open in texture. They have a low exchange capacity and are deficient in organic\\nmatter and plant nutrients.\\n(iv) Laterites - Laterite is a soil type peculiar to India and some other tropical countries,\\ncharacterized by the intermittent occurrence of moist climate. In formation it varies from compact\\nto vesicular rock composed essentially of a mixture of hydrated oxides of aluminium and iron\\nwith small quantities of manganese oxides, titanium,  etc. It is produced by the atmospheric\\nweathering of several types of rocks. Laterites occur in Madhya Pradesh, the coastal region of\\nOrissa, south Maharashtra, Malabar and part of Assam. All lateritic soils are generally very poor\\nin lime and magnesia and deficient in nitrogen. Occasionally, the P2O5 content may be high, but\\nthere is deficient of K2O. In Tamil Nadu, there are both high-level and low-level laterites which\\nare formed from a variety of rock materials under certain climatic and weather conditions. The\\nlaterites at lower elevations grow rice whereas those at higher elevations grow tea, cinchona,\\nrubber and coffee. The soils are rich in nutrients and contain 10 to 20 per cent organic matter.\\n(v) Forest and hill soils - The soil formation is governed mainly by the character of the deposition\\nof organic matter derived from the forest growth. Broadly, two conditions of soil formation may\\nbe distinguished: (i) soils formed under acid condition, with acid humus and low base status, and\\n(ii) soils formed under slightly acid or neutral condition with high base status, which is favour-\\nable to the formation of brown earths. Forest and Hill soils occur in Assam and in Uttar Pradesh,\\nthe Sub Himalayan tract comprises three distinct parts  viz., bhabar area immediately below the\\nhills, tarai and the plains. The tarai areas are characterized by extreme unhealthiness owing to\\nexcessive soil moisture and prolific growth of vegetation. The soils in Coorg has deep surface\\nsoil of great fertility, as it receives annually the decomposed products of the virgin forest. The\\nareas towards the west are for  the greater part reserved under  forests and mountain areas. The\\nland surface is full of pebbles, is easil y drained, and has a laterite bed.\\n(vi) Desert soils - A large part of the arid region of Rajasthan and the Punjab and Haryana, lying\\nbetween the Sutlej and the Aravallis, is affected by desert conditions, which geologically are of\\nrecent origin. This part is covered under a mantle of blown sand, and is dominated by conditions,\\nwhich inhibit soil growth. Some of  the soils contain a high percentage of soluble salts and\\nvarying percentages of calcium carbonate, and possess high pH. They are, however, poor in\\norganic matter. Reclamation is possible only if proper irrigation facilities are made available.\\n(vii) Saline and alkaline soils - These soils are extensively distributed throughout India in all the\\nclimatic zones. These soils occur in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. The\\ninjurious salts are confined to the top layers, being deposited there by the capillary t ransference\\nof saline solutions from the lower stra ta. It has been estimated that nearly 850,000 hectares in\\nUttar Pradesh and over 200,000 hectares in the Punjab and Haryana have been affected by usar.'),\n",

Alkali soils are\\nmet with all over Maharashtra.\\n2.35  MAINTENANCE OF SOIL PRODUCTIVITY\\nA.  Manures\\nImportance of manures in obtaining high crops yields was fully appreciated in ancient India. In Krishi-\\nParashara, it is stated that crops grown without manure will not give yield and a method of preparing\\nmanure from cow dung is described. Kautilya mentioned use of cow dung, animal bones, fishes, and\\nmilk as manure. Agnipurana recommends application of the excreta of sheep and goat and pulverized\\nbarely and sesame allowed to be soaked in meat and water for seven nights to increase flowering and\\nfruiting of trees. In V arahamihira’s Brhat Samhita growing of sesame to flowering stage and then\\nincorporating it as green manure is recommended. The Abhilasitarthacintamani mentions a few such\\nfertilizers—(1) The soil underneath a tree struck by lightning is good for warding off trouble for trees\\nfrom snowfall. (2) Fumigation of trees by burning turmeric, Vidanga, white mustard, flowers of the\\nArjuna tree, mixed with fish and the flesh Rohita (a kind of deer) will not only help the growth of\\nflowers and fruits but will destroy all worms and insects as well as diseases. Surapala (c. 1000 A.D.)\\ndescribes the ‘ancient’ practice of preparing liquid manure (kunapa) prepared by boiling a mixture of\\nanimal excreta, bone marrow, flesh, and dead fish in an iron pot and then adding to it sesame oil cake,\\nhoney, soaked black gram, and a little ghee (or clarified butter). No fixed quantities of materials were\\nrequired to prepare ‘kunapa’. This liquid manure was mainly used in raising trees and shrubs. Tradi-\\ntional agriculture practiced in the Himalayas regions of the sub continent involves use of green leaf\\nmanure as the main fertilizer for the ri ce crop. Surapala and Sar angadhara recommended the use of\\nkunapa for properly nourishing trees. The preparation of kunapa is described by Sarangadhara as\\nfollows: “One should boil the flesh, fat and marrow of deer, pig, fish, sheep, goat, and rhinoceros in\\nwater and when it is properly boiled one should put the mixture in an earthen pot and add into the\\ncompound milk, powders of sesame oil cake, masa (b lack gram) boiled in honey, the decoction of\\npulses, ghee, and hot water. There is no fixity as to the amount of any of these elements; when the said\\npot is put in a warm place for about a fo rtnight, the compound becomes what is called kunapa water\\nwhich is very nutritious for plants in general”. Prior to Sarangadhara, Surapala had referred to kunapa\\nand ingredients included excreta, bone mar row, flesh, brain, and blood of boar mixed with water and\\nstored underground. Surapala also referred to “available” materials and these could be animal fat,\\nmarrow, and the flesh of fish, ram, goat, and other homed animals. Other materials were more or less\\nthe same as mentioned by Sarangadhara, except that quantities of ghee and honey indicated were small.\\nIt should not be difficult to standardize and prepare kunapa water concentrates on mass scale and make\\nthese available in jars to users. Here is an opportunity for an enterprise to help farmers, especially the\\norchardists. Firminger (1864) who was a “Chap lain of the Bengal Establishment” mentions beneficial\\nuse of “liquid manure”, prepared the way Kunapa was prepared, for vegetable cultivation. He has given\\nno information about who first thought of liquid manure”.\\nB. Green Leaf Manures\\nFarmers relied extensively on crop residues legumes and neem for enriching the soil fertility. Ancient\\nTamil texts, widely quoted the use of Calotropis gigantea, Morinda tinctoria, Thespesia populnea,\\nJatropha gossypifoila and Adathoda sp., to be used as green leaf manure. Crop rotation and intercropping\\nwere practiced to restore soil fertility. Fauna such as ants, earthworms and frogs were used to improve'),\n",

Composting practices have also been documented in ancient literature on ideal\\nfarming practices. The farmers of Tamil Nadu manure the soil with farmyard manure (FYM), oil cakes,\\ncompost and green manures or green leaf manures is an age-old practice.\\nC.  Recycling\\nRecycling of nutrients through pond e xcavation was achieved through tank silt or pond excavation in\\nthe foothill zones. The sediments from ponds coming from open spaces, field, etc., during the monsoon.\\nThe sewage slurry and dissolved minerals and nutrients in water coming from animal sheds and house-\\nhold washings are also diverted to the common village pond. All the flocculated clay and organic\\nmaterials usually settle quickly to give clear water of the pond. Animals used to drink water from this\\npond. As soon as the ponds dry up in summer season, the farmers dig the pond base by lifting the soil\\nand transport it to the fields. The surface layer of pond base usually removed is about 30 cm depth. This\\nis a rich source of plant nutrients. The a pplication of pond sludge to each field is done once in a span\\nof 10–15 years. Tank silt increases clay content in light textured red soils, which helps to increase soil\\nmoisture content and finally the crop yield. In Coimbatore and Trichy districts, farmers apply tank silt\\nto crops like banana, turmeric and jasmine where as in Ramanathapuram farmers apply it to rice @ 25\\nt/ha. The excavation of pond basin and its a pplication to field was abandoned with the introduction of\\nchemical fertilizers. Farmers excavate ‘murrum’ a uppermost weathered basalt rock and apply to the\\nfields.\\nD.  Compost\\nThe compost becomes ready to use in five to six months. This partially decomposed farmyard manure\\nafter spreading evenly in the field is worked into the soil by ploughing followed by planking.\\nCrop straw Grain to straw ratio\\nRice 1:1:5\\nPearl millet 1:2:0\\nMaize 1:1:5\\nCotton 1:6:0\\nWheat 1:1:5\\nBarley 1:1:5\\nMustard 1:2:0\\nPulses 1:1:0\\nSugarcane 1:0:2\\nE.  Penning\\nPenning of sheep, goat, cattle and pig in the fallow fields is common. One or two fields by rotation are\\nkept fallow to receive the animal dung and urine during summer as well as winter months. Large herds\\nof sheep, goat and cattle are kept in the fallow fields. The farmers used to feel obliged and usually come\\nwith a request to cattle her d owners for the night stays at their farm land. The litters of sheep get well\\nmixed with soil during the period of penning. Light cultivation before the onset of monsoon makes it\\nmore effective. Sheep feed on the existing farm residue and drops litter in the same field during resting\\nperiod. The excreta of sheep is acidic in r eaction. On each piece of land, penning is continued for 2 to\\n4 days depending on the size of the floc ks to gather or accumulate sufficient manure to improve the\\nfertility status of the soil.'),\n",

Over a large part of the country rain has always been unequally and\\nirregularly distributed and that is why Indian culti vators have sought to supplement the rainfall by\\ndigging wells and conserve it by tanks and storage reservoirs.\\nA.  Ancient Irrigation\\nArchaeological investigations in Inamagaon in Maharastra, India (1300 B.C.), revealed a large mud\\nembankment on a stone foundation for diverting f loodwater from the Ghod river through a channel.\\nRigveda mentions irrigation of crops by river water through channels as well as irrigation from wells.\\nIn the Rigveda, the word “well” frequently occurs (videante) and is described as “unfailing and full of\\nwater”. Water was raised from the well by means of a wheel, a strap and water pails, and also perhaps\\nby buckets tied by rope to one end of a long w ooden pole, working about a fulcrum near the other end\\nthat carried a heavy weight. The same old cr ude method is still prevalent in some parts of Northern\\nIndia. Another method largely employed is to raise water by a small canoe tied by four strings-two at\\neach side and worked between two men standing on a wooden platform projecting over a shallow\\nreservoir. The canoe is swung to and fro, and at  each end of the swing, water rises and pours out into\\nthe main channel. Macdonell and Keith find clear references to artificial water channels used for\\nirrigation as practiced in the times of the Rigveda and Atharvaveda.\\nB.  References in Epics, Arthasastra, Law-books and Jatakas\\nNarada enunciates, “No grain is ever produced without water, but too much water tends to spoil the\\ngrain”. An inundation is injurious to crops and drainage has to be provided.

Arthasastra\\nof Kautilyas refers to sluice gates of tanks and mentions that ‘persons letting out the water of tanks at\\nany other place other than their sluice gate shall pay a fine of six panas’ and persons who obstruct the\\nflow of water from the sluice gate of tanks shall also pay the same fine. It is further stated that ‘the water\\nof a lower tank, excavated later on, shall not irrigate the field already irrigated by a higher tank and the\\nnatural flow of water from a higher to a lo wer shall not be stopped, unless the lower tank has ceased\\nto be useful for three consecutive years. Costs were le vied on irrigated water regardless of the source.\\nAbout the same time, 4th century B.C., the large Sudarshan lake was constructed in Gujarat and it was\\nsubsequently provided with conduits. In western India, the tradition of constructing tanks for irrigation\\ncontinued throughout the ancient period. Buddhist literature (500–300 B.C.) provides evidence of\\nbuilding small tanks for irrigation (Randhawawa, 1980).\\nExtensive tank irrigation systems were developed in Sri Lanka and southern India during the first\\ntwo centuries of the Christian era. Availability of irrigation made it possible to extend cultivation of rice\\nto large areas, and thus improve food security. Sri Lanka knowledge of tank irrigation technology was\\nmost advanced. They could build large tanks and control release of water by 3rd century B.C. (Brohier,\\n1934). It is most likely that the contemporary and subsequent kingdoms in southern India got the\\nbenefit of Sri Lanka expertise in building tanks. The philosophy about the efficient 12th century Sri\\nLankan king. He stated, “In such a country, let not even a small quantity of water obtained by rain, go\\nto the sea, without benefiting man”. As many as 14 large irrigation tanks existed in the northern half of\\nSri Lanka in the ancient times.\\nTopography of the Telangana region of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in India is ideally suited for\\nthe construction of tanks. A special feature of tanks in Te langana is their construction in series, by\\nbunding the same valley at several points. Surplus water from one tank fed the tank at a lower elevation\\nand so on. In Tamil Nadu, the Chola king Karikalan (c. 190 A.D.) and his successors constructed\\nirrigation tanks off the river Cauvery through canals and several of these exist to this day. For the\\nmaintenance of tanks, a committee of villagers call ed eri-variyam was appointed. The committee\\nensured repairs and desilting of tanks and distribution of water. During Pallava times (200–900 A.D.)\\narrangements were made for their repair and maintenance of building dams, embankments, tanks and\\naquaducts in southern India. Ancient dynasties from Mauryans to Mughals evolved various systems for\\nsoil water management such as anaicuts, earthen dams, field bunds, check dams, canals, tanks, ponds,\\nwells and reservoirs. Babur observed two methods of irrigation from wells were with the aid of a\\nwooden Persian Wheel and a leather bucket drawn over a pulley in northern India prior to Arab inva-\\nsions.\\nC.  Locating Water Table - Keys to the Finding of Water Source\\nChakrapani in his ‘Visva V allava’ has dealt in detail as how one can have an approximate idea regarding\\nwater below the surface of different kinds of lands, based on certain characteristics on the land. Gen-\\nerally water is found near or below a marshy place, at sea side, just by its shore, and in the desert, rocky\\nand mountainous country far deep. From a mountain or from the root of a tree the underground artery\\n(sometimes) goes below into a spring. At some places all the arteries are seen to terminate in caves.\\nWhile digging if stone-like hard earth is reached and when struck it sounds like a thin slab of stone, then\\nthere is sure to be plenty of water beneath it. If in a place devoid of any water reservoir, there is found\\na rank growth of V etasa (rattan), then there would be an artery of water two cubits below the surface'),\n",

Locating Water in Arid Areas\\nAgriculture in India mainly depended on rainfall since ancient times. People knew that much of the rain\\nwater percolates through the soil and flows under ground through aquifers. Observations about ground\\nwater and its exploration have been made by Saraswata Muni who was well versed with botany and\\nzoology and Manava Muni who was a geologist. According to their observations, the presence of an ant\\nhill or that of a serpent den was regarded as an indication of the underground water. A number of trees\\nlike Banyan, Gular, Palas (Butea monosperma), Bilwa (Semicarpus anacardium) has water at a particular\\ndepth in a particular direction. Manava  Muni surmises presence of water by colour of the soil or of\\nrocks and stones. He has given a list of the plants or trees, which indicates presence of water. V arahamihira\\nwas the greatest astronomer of the 6th century A.D. who had made certain observations on water\\nexploration. According to him water in the ground is available in an arid place near V etasa plant\\n(Calamus rotalg); gular tree (Ficus glomerata), where current of sweet water many be found; in place\\nwhere bilwa and gular trees are found growing together; if there is an ant-hill to the north of arjuna\\n(Terminalia arjzma) tree; if there is a coconut tree with ant hill; if nirgundi tree (Vitex negzmdo) is found\\nwith an ant hill; if ant hill is inhabited by a serpent and is near to the north side of Mahuwa tree\\n(Madhuka indica); near the milky trees having long branches; at spots where trees, shrubs and creepers\\nare fresh and fine and leaves are unborn and near grasses of specific types. Digging of wells was not\\nvery common and people depended more on the monsoons and river water. Shallow wells were dug\\nthrough human labour and water was lifted through indigenous devices which operated on man and\\nanimal power. These wells were dug after careful selection of site and after ascertaining availability of\\nground water through water diviners.\\nAncient teachers have enumerated many methods of divining water in arid regions. If there is seen\\nhot vapour (rising from the earth) then there would be found a stream of water at the depth of two man-\\nlengths and underground vegetation.

At the depth of first man-length\\nthere would be found a snake with black and white spots and plenty of salt (water) at the depth of three\\nman-lengths. If an ant-hill stands to the east of Indradru (Terminalia arjuna), then just at one cubit to\\nthe west there would be found water at the depth of twenty man-lengths and an iguana only at the depth\\nof one man-length.

If there be Kusa grass\\ngrowing over an ant-hill or there be pale-white adurva then twenty one man-lengths below it would be\\nfound water.\\nE.  Locating Water in Marshy Lands\\nIn a marshy country there are green herbs and the land is wet and full of mosquitoes. There is Andropogon\\nmuricatus. There is plenty of sweet water underground at the depth of one man-length. Where there are\\nsucculent herbs such as Ipomoea turpethum; creepers (garuda), Jyotismati (Cardiospermum helicacabum),\\nCyperus, there water is found very near (the surface). Towards the south of a grove of thick trees and\\ncreepers there is plenty of water at the depth of four cubits. In a valley the land is low, covered with\\ngreen turf, sandy, resonant and rich in water.\\nF.  Locating Water in Mountainous Country\\nSarasvata and V araha described clear formulae with respect to the mountainous country. Where there\\nis a cluster of the Bodhi tree, Udumbarika, Palasa and Nyagrodha, at one place, water would be found\\nthree man-lengths below them even in arid and marshy lands. The place where the trees have glossy and\\nthick foliage and shrubs and creepers have milky juice has sweet water very near (the surface) and is\\ninhabited by sweet-voiced birds. In a place where there grow Kharjuri, Jambu, Sata-patra, Nipa,\\nSinduvara, V ata, Naktamala, Andumbari, Kakaranva and Vibhitaka, there water would be found at a\\ndepth of three man-lengths.\\nWater is said to exist underground in a place where flowering trees and plants like Jati, Kusthaka,\\nCampaka, etc., and fruit-bearing trees like the pomegranate, lime ( Citrus acida) and citron are found\\nto grow. Where on a hilly place the Tala tree, the coconut, tree, Kancanara, V etasa or any other trees\\nare found to grow, sweet water is found there in plenty. What has been previously described as a\\nNirjahara (water-fall or cascade) is found in a mountainous country issuing from the crevices between\\nthe rocks or from the roots of the trees. In a wet mountainous country a stream with a copious flow of\\nwater is generally found to flow from under the vegetation. Sometimes such a stream is also found to\\nexist underground at holy places with shrines. Near the rocks that glisten like a copper vessel facing the\\neast (i.e., sun), or like glass and Vaidurya (eat’s eye) or are bright like the pearls, or grey like the Patasa,\\nor brown in colour, there is plenty of water. Wher e the dark blue soil or the black soil is found in\\nconjunction with gravel, or where there is white coloured soil and sand or where there is yellowish soil,\\nthere exists sweet water. In brown soil the water is acrid in taste and in polish soil (of smooth surface)\\nit is salt.\\nG.  Construction of Reservoirs\\nAfter the location of underground water, Chakrapani describes in his book “Visva Vallabha”  the\\nconstruction of reservoirs in the following paragraphs: “When water has been located, reservoirs of\\nvarious shapes and sizes should be constructed outside the villages, their sites and measurements being\\ndetermined by the availability of space. An artificial reservoir may be of six shapes, viz., circular,\\nquadrangular ( i.e., square), triangular, polygonal, oblong and semi-circular (half-moon-shaped). Its'),\n",

T he best reservoir should measure one thousand poles (or\\n4000 cubits) in length, medium-sized would be half of it and the smallest one quarter. The size of other\\nreservoirs is determined by the availability of space. A big reservoir, in which there will always remain\\na large store of water, can be constructed at  a lesser cost by constructing a dam between two hills, or\\nin a mountain valley or on a spacious place at the top of a hill. If there be a wide and high table land\\non all sides with great influx of water and a narrow outlet for the exit of water, then a big reservoir can\\nbe made by constructing a dam there. A wise person should provide a descent of steps from the top of\\nthe dam to the bottom of the reservoir and for making the dam strong he should have it plastered with\\nlime cement both on the inner as well as outer face.\\nA land low from all sides when full of water tur ns into a pond and becomes a natural reservoir.\\nThere can be no prescribed measurements for it. In the middle of the lakes and on their banks, there are\\npleasure houses of the kings. For the purpose of pleasure-tr ip or frolicking in water a boat should be\\nkept there or an approach to the pleasure-house be made by means of a bridge (or causeway). A tank\\nwith three peaks (? angles) and one opening is called Nanda, that with Bhadra, the one with nine peaks\\nand three openings is Jaya and that with twelve peaks and four openings is called Vijaya .If at the\\nbottom of the well there is found to be sand, a foundation pedestal made of hard wood should be placed\\nbelow in a manner that it does not block its springs of water.\\nA Kunda (pit) is of four kinds, viz., Bhadra, Subhadra, Parigha and Nanda. The first is four-sided,\\nthe second is Bhadra, the third Subhadra and in the middle the fourth connected with Peatibhadra. They\\n(i.e., the Kundas) should measure one hundred and eight cubits on each side with four openings, one\\nin each direction, and a half in one corner provided with a qua drangular courtyard and ventilators\\ninside. A very deep natural pool which has come into existence of itself may be of various shapes. Its\\nembankments may be paved as they are with stone and lime mortar.\\nH.  Changing Water Quality\\nChakrapani in his book “Visva Vallabha” describes the methods to change water quality. If the powder\\nof Khadira is poured into a well whose water is saline or acrid in taste, the water would be turned sweet.\\nThe turbid and pungent smelling water of pools etc. would turn sweet and pellucid if the powder as well\\nas the juice of Kakubha, Musta, Usira, fruits of Dhatri and Kanaka and of Rodhra (Symplocos racemosa)\\nand Rajasana is poured into them. The juice of Abhaya (Terminalia chebula) and the powder of Pathya\\nTerminalia citrina), Kustha, Cardamom and Kataka fruit (Strychnos potatorum) along with the essence\\nof Khadira and the fruit of wood-apple, if thrown in the turbid water or the salt water of well, they\\nwould at once turn the water (clear) and sweet.\\nI.  Ancient Irrigation Systems\\nDevices for irrigation water lifting range from age-old indigenous water lifts to highly efficient pumps.\\nPumps operated by electric motors or engines have come into prominence in all large-scale lift irriga-\\ntion schemes. There are several types of indigenous wa ter lifts are in use in India. They may be\\nmanually operated or animal-operated. Based on the optim um range in the height of lift, they may be\\ngrouped under devices for low lift, medium lift and high lift.\\nLow Head Water Lifts:  The swing basket, don, Archemedian screw, and water wheel are\\nsuitable when the depth to wa ter surface does not exceed 1.2 m.\\nMedium Head Water Lifts: Medium head lifts are suitable when the height of lift is within the\\nrange of 1.2-10 m. The Persian wheel, chain pump, leather bucket lift with self emptying bucket,\\ncircular two-bucket lift and the counterpoi se-bucket lift fall in this category.'),\n",

The only indigenous water lift suitable for deep\\nwells is the rope-and-bucket lift ( Charasa) operated by bullocks.\\nJ.  Rain Water Harvesting Techniques\\nThe most common practices followed by the farmers to conserve the soil moisture are summer tillage,\\nfield boundary bund with vegetative cover, use of farm yard manure  and intercultural operation with\\nhand/bullock drawn equipments. Farmers have followed the surface water harvesting rainwater harvest-\\ning techniques such as local percolation tank, farm pond, Tanka, Nada, Nadi, Talai, Talba, Khadin, Sar,\\nSagar and Samand. The water-harvesting methods differ from region depending upon rainfall,\\ntopography and soil type.\\nTanka is constructed on farm in courtyard fort, etc . The shape of the Tanka is generally kept\\ncircular; however square Tankas are also constructed in buildings, fo rts and palatial buildings\\netc., for harvesting roof water, 2 m diameter and 3 m deep Tanka (capacity 10000 liter) is\\ncommon. The Tanka is made on sloping land to arrest run off water in the farm however in house\\nthe construction is made on an elevated place to avoid entry of water into it.\\nTalai is about 2–3 m deep, the soil scooped out from the Talai is spread around to make\\ncatchments area keeping its slope in mind special attention is paid for selection of locations such\\nthat there is adequate flow of rainwater into the Talai. Care is also taken so that loose soil does\\nnot flow along with water stream into the Talai. In contrast to the Tanka, the Talai is kept open\\nfrom the top. A pucca masonry ram entrance is also provided on one side of the Talai to facilitate\\ndistribution of water using camel, donkey, bullock cart, etc. The stored water is generally used\\nfor animals.\\nNada is a common method of conserving rainwa ter in villages. Low-lying area in between\\nhillocks the catchments area of the Nada is 5 to 10 ha. The Nada is constructed on rangeland,\\nbarren land, pasture land and agricultural field. It provides short-term storage of rainwater and\\nmainly used for animals.\\nNadi - Compared to Nada high embankment is provided around the Nadi. Depth of Nadi is kept\\nup to 6–8 m. Catchments area of 10 to 150 ha is common for a Nadi. However area as high as\\n200 ha is found in certain specific cases. Nadi is generally constructed on sloppy area so that\\nexcess runoff water flows out without causing any damage to the embankment. Adequate clean-\\nliness is maintained in the watershed to maintain purity or stored water. Bath is prohibited inside\\nthe Nadi. In the Nadi, water is available for whole of the year as a result it is shelter home for\\nmany wild animals and birds.\\nTalab - Talab is relatively shallow and spread over to more area compared to Nadi Runoff from\\nhillocks is channels to a low-lying area in the v icinity and adequately bunded to form a Talab.\\nIt is generally constructed on rangeland.\\nKhadin - Khadin is the ancient indigenous rainwater harvesting method mainly found in jaisalmer\\ndistrict. Accumulation of runoff water in between hillocks is known as khadin. Khadin means\\ncultivation of crops in about 60–70 ha area. The khandi water is generally used for crop culti-\\nvation under preserved moisture conditions and animals consumption.\\n7. Sar, Sagar and Samand: In certain district of Thar Dessert sar, sagar and samand are used to harvest\\nrainwater for irrigation purposes.'),\n",

History of Salinization in India – A Lesson for the Future\\nThought the dug wells and constructed canals to suppl y water for cr op production (2000-6000 B.C.),\\nno record of the rise of salinity irrigated tracts is documented with the development of canal irrigation\\nfrom the era of sultan Feroz Shah Tughlak (1351–88) to the fall of Mughal Empire (1857) the salty\\npatches in the soil said to have developed due to canal irrigation. Disappeared when the canals went into\\ndisuse. Irrigation is a mixed blessing water-logging and salinity closely follow. In the past all such lands\\nthat used to be unfit for agriculture were called as ushtra in Sanskrit meaning sterile or barren also\\ncalled usar. Usar lands were adversely affected with arid climate or scarcity of water. Lands adversely\\naffected with excess of salts, neutral (NaCl) or alkali (NaHCO 3, Na2CO3) were also called as reh by\\ngeologists in mid-nineteenth century to characterize the appearance of salt efflorescence on the surface\\nof lands. In the chalcolithic period (c. 1300 B.C.) irrigated farming which was developed in hilly\\nuplands shifted to lower river valleys. Floodwaters were stored in reservoirs for irrigation in the valleys\\nand canals were dug. Hence chalcolithic period is also called the era of irrigated farming. Archaelolgists\\nhave found a canal constructed dating back to the pre-harappan period (3000 B.C.) at Kunal (Hisar,\\nHaryana). Which was linked to the Saraswathi River about 5000 years ago. During the V edic period\\n(3700–2000 B.C.) the peasants dug wells and constructed canals to supply water to the crops. There is\\nreference to irrigation by canals taken from the rivers there is also re ference to soil erosion by rivers.\\nThe Aryans being in Northern India had e xperience on ushara land, ‘Alkali soil’. The Chola King\\nKarikalan (190 A.D.) and his successors constructed V ennara and Arasil canals, which take off from\\nCauveri river by means of channels drawn from dams, called anaicuts or dike.\\nL.  Canal Irrigation in India\\nThe development of canal irrigation began in the 14th century at the initiative of Sultan Feroz Shah\\nTughlak (1351–88), a pioneer in canal irrigation in the medieval times. During hid period five canals\\nwere dug among these the most important was the Western Jamuna Canal. The salty patches in the soil,\\nwhich developed under canal irrigation disappeared when the canal went into disuse after the fall of\\nMughal Empire in 1817. Blane was appointed by the Government of India to restore the WJC, which\\ntook 3 years due to paucity of funds. Alignment of the old Munghal canal consisting of natural channels\\nand depressions was adhered, w hich resulted in the formation of la rge swamps and extensive water\\nlogging. The Eastern Jamuna Canal (EJC) was taking off from the river on its eastern bank near\\nNaushera in Uttar Pradesh, which was designed by Ali Mardan khan in the days of Shah Jahan. It was\\nabandoned soon after construction due to the declining power of Mughals, but re-opened in January\\n1830. The Ganga canal belongs to the last years of the East India Company’s rule. Cautley, in 1839, a\\nmilitary engineer, proposed to adopt a direct line from Hardwar to Roorkee. The canal was opened in\\nApril 1854 and irrigated large areas of U ttar Pradesh and the Pre-partition Punjab. Other canals con-\\nstructed for protection against famine,  viz., Sirhind Canal (Punjab) 1873–82, Lower Ganga Canal and\\nthe Betwa Canal (North-West Provinces), 1881-93. Mutha Canal and Khadakwasa Dam (Bombay\\nPresidency), 1869–79 and the Nira River Canals (Bombay Presidency) 1877–94.\\nM.  Advancement in Irrigation Potential during 20th Century\\nWhen the benefits of canal irrigation in British Indi a became apparent, interest ar ose for such projects\\nin some princely states. The pioneer was the Mysore state that planed a Kannabadi Dam, later named\\nthe Krishna Raja Sagar Dam (after the ruler of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadeyar II), constructed under\\nconfluence of three rivers, viz., the Kaveri, Hemavathi, and the Kakshmanatirtha. Two canals, namely,\\nthe north bank high-level canal (Visvesvaraya Canal) and the north bank low-level canal, took off from\\nthe reservoir.

The project comprised of a dam across the river Manjira, a tributary of Godavari\\nriver. The Gang canal (1922–27), which takes off from the Sutlej River at the Ferozpore barrage on its\\nleft bank, was to irrigate land in the princely state of Bikaner. It was built with the initiative of Maharaja\\nGanga Singh (1880–1943) of Bikaner. The Sarda Canal Project in the United Provinces of Agra and\\nOuch was started in 1915 during the Viceroy alty of Lord Hardinge, and was completed in 1926.\\nGovernment of India through Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) launched the All India\\nCo-ordinated Scheme for studies on soil salinity and water management at different locations in 1968.\\nIt set up Central Soil Salinity Research Institute (CSSRI) at Karnal and Water Technology Centre at\\nNew Delhi in 1969. A part from these, another co-originated scheme on use of saline water in agriculture\\ncame in operation in 1972 at 5 centers in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan,  Karnataka, Andhra\\nPradesh and Maharashtra.\\n2.37 PLANT PROTECTION\\nPlant protection began when man attempted to understand ailments affecting crops. Crop plants are\\naffected through ‘abiotic’ and ‘biotic’ disorders. Insects came on the agriculture scene more than 250\\nmillion years ago well before the human beings who appeared only about one million years age. The\\nassociation of man with insects was well known to Indians who knew production of silk and lac in the\\ndays before 3870 B.C. The documents available on man’s efforts to protect crops are found in the\\nRigveda (c. 3700 B.C.), Krishi-Parashara (c. 100 B.C.), Sangam literature of Tamil (200 BC–100 A.D.),\\nAgni-Purana (c. 400 A.D.) Varaha Mihiria’s Brhat-Samhita (c. 500 A.D.) Kashyapiyakrishisukti\\n(c. 800-900 A.D.) Suprapala’s Vrikshayurveda (c. 1000 B.C.) Someshwera Deva’s Manasollasa\\n(c. 1100 A.D.), Sarangadhara’s Upavanavinoda (c. 1300 A.D.), Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri (c.1600 A.D.) Dara,\\nShikoh’s Nuskha Dar Fanni–Falahat (c. 1650 A.D.) Jati Jaichand’s diary (1689–1714 A.D.) an anony-\\nmous Rajasthani manuscript (1877 A.D.) and Watt’s Dictionary of Economic Products of India\\n(1889–1893 A.D.). Since the agriculture has a very long history of more than 10000 years its gradual\\ndevelopment can be discussed briefly in the following periods for greater clarity: (i) The Ancient Period\\n10,000 B.C. to beginning of anno Domini (A.D.): ( ii) The Medieval period beginning of A.D. to 18th\\nCentury A.D. and (iii) The Modern period –19th Century A.D. to date.\\nA.  The Ancient Period\\n One of the major events in human history is the transition from hunting, gathering to agriculture.\\nSusruta Samhita (400 B.C.) emphasized the importance of protecting seeds from white ants and Kautilya\\n(321–296 B.C.) was the first to suggest use of seed dressers for producing healthy plant stands. There\\nis reference to algae and mushrooms in Rigveda only as saprophytes. In the Buddhist document\\nKallavagga (C. 100 B.C.) “mildew of paddy” and blight of sugarcane” is mentioned. In Krishi-Parashara\\n(Sadhale, 1999) we find that the plant protection in ancient days was not covered in depth, except for\\nprayers to God Indra and other supernaturals. However there were several reference to the crop losses\\ncaused by insect pests. For example in the verse 126 it is stated “Commencing plowing on the 14th day\\nof the month in any agriculture season was not shown as auspicious and met with several loss through\\ninsect pests”. Also emphasized were the auspicious “lagnas” for initiating agriculture in a particular\\nseason such as Turus (21st April) based on the movement of the sun’s entrance into the respective\\nzodiac signs.\\nB.  Use of Organic Materials\\nThe oldest documents on the use of organic materials to control crop disorders is probably the Kautilya’s'),\n",

(Shamasastry, 196 1), cut ends of sugarcane setts meant for planting were\\nplastered with a mixture of honey ghee, the fat of hogs and cow dung. V arahamihira (Bhat, 1981)\\nsuggested use of milk ghee and cow dung for dressing seeds and smoking them by burning animals\\nflesh or turmeric before sowing. He also suggested sprinkling seeds with a mixture of flowers of cereals\\nlegumes and sesame as well as stable minced meat. Literature in agriculture during with knowledge on\\nseeds storage crop protection and use of botanical pesticides Neem leaves were commonly used to\\ncontain the storage insects and seed infection during storage.  There is also a mention about the use of\\nseed treatment with coal ash before storage to pr event insect damage during storage. Pigeonpea seeds\\nwere before storage (Sun drying of seeds to reduce moisture content) w as a common practice during\\nAncient Period for the management of insect pests (Jeyarajan, 1999).\\nC.  The Medieval Period\\nThe earliest specific reference to insects pests is f ound in Krishi-Parashara. Rice pest, the gandhi bug\\n(Leptocorisa varicornis F.) has been mentioned. Another word, pandarundi (White ear head) possibly\\nimplied rice stem borer (Trporyza incetulas walker) (Sadhale, 1999). Jahangir, the Mughal Emperor in\\nIndia (1605–1627) in his memories described a disorder of marigold that could be ascribed today to\\nspecies of Alternaria botrytis, or Sclerotia. The occurrence of melon fruit fly Dacus sp. during 1620\\nA.D. and the non-availability of control measures during that time were discussed (Nene, 1998). Jati\\nJaichand’s diary (1658–1714) mentions possibly botrytis gray mould of chickpea and ear blight\\n(Curvularia penniseti) of pearl millet (Javalia et al., 2001).\\nD.  Practices Using Inorganic and Organic Materials\\nIt was Someshwara Deva (c. 1126 A.D.), a Chaluyka king, who suggested treatment of seed with ash,\\nbesides other materials to ensure good germination (Shamasastry, 1926): Use of ash however was\\nsuggested as far back as 120 B.C. by V arro a Roman encylopedist (Orlob, 1973), and was known to\\nTamils (Jeyarajan 1999). Dara Shikoh (Razia Akbar, 2000) mentioned the use of common salt solution\\nfor soaking fig cuttings prior to planting. Appar ently salt was used to disinfect cuttings. Unfortunately\\nconcentration of salt solution was not mentioned.\\nNuskha Dar Fanni-Falahat (Razia Akbar, 2000) has many recommendations to project plant species\\nfrom insects, fruit-drop, fruit cracking heat,  and cold. These are:\\n\\x7f Use of dung garlic, and pine oil should protect the cuttings from damage by some insects and\\npathogens. Burning of garlic was recommended for “expelling caterpillar s” by the Roman\\nauthor Palladius (Orlob, 1973).\\n\\x7f Resin application to roots has been recommended for preventing cracking of pomegranate is\\nfound in ancient literature.\\n\\x7f Application of excreta of sheep, pig and donkey and human urine can at best keep the apple tree\\nwell nourished which in turn perhaps keeps insect and diseases damage animals.\\n\\x7f A practice that is still followed to protect melons from excessive heat or cold has been men-\\ntioned. Covering melon fruits earthen pots is a practice that small farmers can follow today.\\nE.  Fumigation\\nDiseases of cucurbits were controlled through smoking by burning the bones of cow and dog mixed the\\nexcreta of cat (Sadhale, 1996). For the control of insect pests several ancient recommendations avail-\\nable are given in Table 15 (Saxena and Choudhary 1996).'),\n",

Though\\nIndian agriculture in the modern age is making large strides of progress it is necessary to consider the\\ntreasure of ancient knowledge particularly the development and use of safer pesticides for the\\ndevelopment of mankind.\\nJ.  Harvesting, Threshing and Storage\\nIn Riveda, harvesting of barely with sickles was mentioned. Harvesting was done both by cutting down\\nthe crop at ground level and by cutting off the earheads. Threshing was done on the threshing floor and\\nwinnowing with a supa. Cleaned grain was stored in storage bins and a trash burned. In Krishi-Parashara,\\nmaking of a levelled threshing pit and installation of a threshing pillar called medhi were mentioned.\\nThe wood for the pillar was obtained from a tree that produces milky sap, obviously to get wood that\\nis not too hard lest the grain in broken. The pillar was treated with neem ( Azadirachta indica A. Juss)\\nleaves and mustard.\\nParashara mentions adhaka, a wooden vessel with a capacity of about 3.5 kg (paddy rice). The\\ngrain was stored at a place safe from termites, rats, and other pests. Kautilya’s Arthasastra states, “Grain\\nand other crops shall be collected as often as they are harvested crops. When reaped, shall be heaped\\nin high piles or in the form of turrets. The crops piles shall not be kept close. The threshing floors of\\ndifferent fields shall be in close proximity. Workmen in the fields shall always have water the stalks by\\nbeating them on the ground or by making the bullocks tread on them. Cleared paddy was collected,\\nmeasured and stored in proper places. Sickles and swor ds were used for harvesting millet heads. For\\nthreshing, buffaloes were made to tread or men used to thresh the ears with their feed. Black gram was\\nthreshed with sicks. Women considerably contributed to threshing and cleaning. A common vessel for\\nmeasuring grain was referred to as ambanam.\\nK.  Post Harvest Storage Pest Management\\nA majority of farmers were found to do threshing of maize and paddy manually. To prevent food grains\\nfrom insect infestation, use of neem leaves, ash, salt, camphor, etc., either singly or in combination was\\ncommon. For storage of seed, use of kerosene + ash, and onion was popular. Some of the respondents\\nwere mixing neem paste, kerosene, or sheep or goat faces with mud for use as plaster of the storage\\nstructure. Use of indigenous practices f or controlling the rats like live-tr aps keeping dogs and cats,\\nfilling the burrows with ash, pieces of glass, bunch of hair and then plastering them was common in the\\ntribal as well as non-tribal areas. Indigenous practices used by the respondent in storage of produce\\nare: ( i) Cow dung cake + neem leaves, ( ii) Neem + mud (for plastering), ( iii) Mud + kerosene\\n(for plastering), (iv) Mud + faces of goat/sheep (for plastering), ( v) Neem + ash, ( vi) Ash + mercury +\\nAsh, (vii) Husk, ( viii) Ash + salt (rice), ( ix) Neem + ash + campher, ( x) Neem + husk, ( xi) onion for\\nseed, etc.'),\n",

Excavations at\\nHarappa have indicated that people were familiar with date palm, pomegranate, lemon, melon, and\\npossibly coconut. Rigveda mentions seve ral trees such as papal ( Ficus religiosa L.), Khadir ( Acacia\\ncatechu wild), Shisham ( Dalbergia sisoo Roxb.), Shimbalam ( Bombax malabaricum DC) and palasa\\n(Butea frondosa Roxb.). The Aryans of Vedic times were quite understandably lovers of nature. The\\nname they gave to flowers, sumansa, “that which pleases the mind”, reveals their aesthetic sensibilities.\\nIt is these sensibilities which were reflected in their gardens and a very ref ined art of gardening. In\\nArtha Sastra, more than 30 tree species are mentioned as those found in forests and edible fruit trees\\nare mentioned without qualification. Emperor Ashoka (274–237 B.C.) encouraged arbori-horticulture.\\nCommonly grown fruit trees were plantain, mango, jackfruit and grapes. The Sangam literature refers\\nto jackfruit, coconut, date palm, arecanut, plantain, and tamarind. Agrnipurna mentions many trees; it\\nhas a separate PART on horticulture which formed the base of treatises that followed. Varahimihira\\nwrote a PART on “treatment of trees’ in his Brhat–Samhita. One of the highlights of Varahimihira\\nwriting is specific reference on grafting to be done on tr ees such as jack fruit,  plantain, jambu (Black\\nplum) Kapittaha (Limnoia acidissima L.) lemon and pomegranate. A method of grafting described was\\nwhat is known today as the ‘wedge grafting”.\\nGardens continued to be an equally important part of the urban landscape in subsequent periods.\\nIn V atsayana’s Kamasutra (300–400 A.D.), “Vrakshayur veda” is mentioned as one of 64 kalas or arts\\nrecognized in ancient India. It included the construction and maintenance of gardens and parks for\\nhealth, recreation and enjoyment. In Jain canonical texts too, among the important parts of a city\\nmentioned are pleasure gardens (arama), gardens ( ujjana) and tanks ( vapi). Gardens continued to be\\nviewed as a source of joy and happiness throughout the ancient period. As the very first verse of the\\nancient text Vrkshayurveda puts it: “He is indeed a monarch if his house has extensive gardens,\\nspacious gardens containing large pools of water with lovely lotus blossoms over which humming bees\\nfly . . . That may be regarded as the consummation of all happiness . . . (giving) intense pleasure to the\\nmind.” The ancient texts have their share of information on the subject. The pleasure grounds surround-\\ning Indraprastha are described in the Mahabharata. The Buddhist text Lalitavistara mentions 500\\ngardens around Kapilavastu, which were laid out for Prince Siddhartha. The divine Nandanakanan is\\nthe god of gardening in Indra’s paradise. The ancient Indian kings built pleasure gardens of immense\\nbeauty for themselves. Megasthenes admiring the palace of Chandragupta wrote, “In the Indian royal\\npalace . . . in the parks tame peacocks are kept and pheasants which are domesticated, there are shady\\ngroves and pasture grounds planted with trees, . . . while some  trees are native to  the soil, others are\\nbrought from other parts and with their beauty enhance the charm of the landscape.” The early Buddhist\\nperiod saw the transition from royal to public gardens at many places. The V enuvana and Ambavana in\\nthe vicinity of Rajagaha, the Mahavana near Vaishali, the Nigrodharama near Kapilavastu and the\\nJetavana in the outskirts of Sravasti were all royal ga rdens of early Buddhist times which later were\\nopened to public and converted into permanent retreats for the monks of different orders. Subsequently\\nmany monastries had their own gardens attached to monastic complexes.\\nHorticulture was well developed in the ancient times referred to in the Jaina canonical literature.\\nV arious types of gardens are mentioned in the canons. Examples are Ujjana (garden), Nijjana (the kings\\nprivate garden), Arama (garden with canopies as resting places), Sahasramravana (mango grove with a\\nthousand mango trees), Agrodyana (home garden in front of the buildings), Ashokavana (garden with\\nashoka trees), Gunashila Udyana (ornamental garden) and Jeernodyana. These gardens had trees, bushes,'),\n",

Aramas canopies covered\\nwith dense creepers that protected the gardens from sun rays and provided cool comfort to the dwellers\\ntherein.\\nThis is how the Chinese pilgrim Hsieun Tsang who arrived at the monastic University of Nalanda\\nin 630 A.D. saw it: “The temple arose into the mists and the shrine halls stood high above the clouds\\n. . . streams of blue water wound through the parks; green lotus flowers sparkled among the blossoms\\nof sandal trees and a mango grove spread outside the enclosure.”\\nAs regards gardens attached to a private dw elling, obviously of the rich and opulent, we have a\\ndescription in V atasayan’s Kamasutra. It states: “attached to every house there should be a vrksavatika\\nor puspavatika, a garden where flowering plants and fruit trees can grow, as well as vegetables. A well\\nor tank, large or small, should be excavated in the middle.” The garden was to be in charge of the\\nmistress of the house and she was to procure seeds of common kitchen vegetables and medicinal herbs\\nevery day. The garden was also to be designed with bowers and vine groves with raised platforms for\\nrest and recreation. A swing was to be fitted on a spot well guarded from the sun by a canopy of foliage.\\nShe was to ensure that it was laid out with beds of plants that yield an abundance of flowers, with an\\nemphasis on those with sweet perfume, like the mallika  and the navamalika, as well as those “that\\ndelight the eye like the japa with its crimson glory or the kurantaka with its unfading yellow splendour.\\nThere should also be rows of shrubs yielding fragrant leaves or roots, like balaka and usirs”. As in all\\nhot climates an expanse of water was an almost essential feature of the ancient garden. Gardens consist\\nof the artificial lakes and pools as well as the steps leading down to them for bathing. Kalidas mentions\\na palace garden called samudragrha, which was a summer house, built in a cool place surrounded on\\nall four sides by fountains. A further refinement, for coo ling the air in the hot season, was the water\\nmachine, variyantra which, from Kalidasa’s description seems to have been a sort of revolving spray,\\nrather like the one used to water lawns. The garden’s irrigation was taken care of by means of narrow\\ndrains (kulya) full of running water with water fountains as their source. Water wheels incessantly threw\\njets of water to flood the flower beds and the circular ditch ( alavala) at the base of the trees. As noted\\nearlier, along with the private gardens of the rich there were in due course public gardens (nagarupvana)\\nas well. When situated outside the to wn they were termed bahirupvana. These were the favourite\\nresorts of the townspeople for udyanyatras or picnics. The Kamasutra mentions how a party of well\\ndressed nagarakas would go out of the town to these gardens early in the morning mounted on horses\\naccompanied by ganikas and followed by servants to spend the day.\\nWith gardens and parks emerging as an important backdrop to the social life in ancient India,\\nhorticulture (udyanavyapara) developed as a discipline and scientific knowledge was applied to the art\\nof arbori-horticulture. In the post V edic literature there is evidence to show that botany developed as an\\nindependent science known as Vrkshayurveda on which were based the science of medicine (as embodied\\nin the Caraka and Susruta samhitas), the science of agriculture (as embodied in the Krsi Prasara) and\\nthe science of horticulture (as illustrated in the Upavanavinoda). While there are no treatises so far\\ndiscovered on the subject of ancient horticulture as such, there is a small part, the Upavanavinoda as\\na br anc\\nh of Vrksayurveda, in Sarngadhara’s encyclopedic work, the Sarangadhara Paddhati of the\\n13th Century, which is a compilation of relevant material from earlier classical sources.\\nA.

The aramas or gardens\\nwere kept in order by a number of junior officers known as aramikas. They were under a superintendent\\naramaprekshaka who supervised their work. There were settlements of park keepers known as aramika\\ngama. Special classes of skilled artisans were patronized by the State.

Gardens at times contained not only flowering plants but also fruit trees which\\nused to bring considerable income to the exc hequer. Gardening in ancient India through design forms\\nand mechanisms and by combining scientific and artistic principles thus ensured an integration of\\nnature with everyday life in urban areas.\\n2.38.1 Arbori–horticulture, Orchards, History and Diversity of Fruit Crops in India\\nA. Tree culture (Vrksayurveda)\\nThe water reservoirs which have no shade on their banks are not pleasing. Hence gardens should be laid\\nin the precincts of reservoir s of water. Soft soil is good for all kinds of trees. First, one should sow\\nsesamum in that soil and when they grow and put forth flowers, they should be uprooted. This is the first\\nprocess in preparing the land. The astrologers have  declared the constellations suc h as Dhruva, Mrdu,\\nMula, Visakha, Brhaspati, Sravana, Aswini and Hasta to be auspicious for the planting of trees. The\\nsoap-nut tree, Asoka, Pumnaga, Sirisa, Pdyangu, are the auspicious trees and should be planted first in\\nthe gardens or the houses. The bread-fruit tree, Asoka, the plantain, the rose-apple, Lakuca, the pome-\\ngranate, the vine, Pativata, the citron and Atimuktaka-these are the trees that grow from scion plastered\\nwith mud. They should be carefully planted by taking their stem or by digging them up from the roots.\\nPlants that have not put forth branches should be transplanted in the winter; those that have put forth\\nbranches, in the beginning of winter ( i.e., the dewy season); and those that have developed trunks, at\\nthe advent of the rainy season according to their r espective quarters. Transplanting of the trees is done\\nafter plastering the root and branch with ghee, usira, sesamum, honey, vidanga, milk and cow dung. The\\nrose apple, Vetasa, V anira, Kadamba, Udumbara) Atjuna, the citron, the vine, Lakuca, the pomegranate,\\nV anjula, Natka-rnala, Tilakll, Panasa, Timira and Amrataka are the sixteen trees that grow in the wet or\\nmarshy soil. A pit one cubit wide and twice as much deep should be dug and filled with water. When\\nit becomes dry it should be heated with fire and t hen plastered with honey and ghee mixed with ashes.\\nIt should then be filled with ground Masas, sesamum and barley mixed with soil. Then pouring the\\nbroth of the flesh of fish over the filling, it should be beaten down till it becomes hard and compact. If\\nthe seed is sown into it four fingers deep and is nurtur ed with fish-broth and gravy, it grows into a\\nsurprising creeper with glistening leaves and soon spreads over the entire bower. Seeds that are soaked\\nin milk for ten days, kept in two hast as of ghee, fumigated with the fumes of the flesh of a hog and deer,\\nand mixed with the fats of fish and hog, grow bearing flowers simultaneously, when sown in a prepared\\nand cleaned soil and nourished with water mixed with milk. Cessation of bearing fruit (i.e., sterility) is\\ncured by Kulattha, Masa, Mudga, sesamum and barley. Along with this, nurturing with boiled and\\ncooled down milk is conducive to the increase of fruit and flower. Two adhakas of the dung of sheep\\nand goats, one adhaka of sesamum, one prastha of meal, a drona of water and beef equal in weight-all\\nthese (mixed together and) kept for a week (lit. 7 nights) should be administered as nurture to trees,\\ncreepers, thickets and plants for making them bear flower and fruit for all times. Diseases like the\\nsearing of leaves, all rest of the growth of leaves, drying up of the branches and excessive exudation of\\nthe sap afflict the trees owing to exposure to cold wind and the sun. Their remedy, according to\\nscientific works, lies first in clearing them (of the diseased part) and then plastering them with the paste'),\n",

Never before or after has religion been so much associated with the tree\\nculture and tree planting. During 237 B.C., emperor Ashoka actively promoted tree planting on large\\nscale. For the first time in the Indian history, a monarch has encouraged tree culture and adopted it as\\na state policy. He encouraged planting of trees in the gardens, along road and in the form of avenues.\\nMughal emperor Jahangir (1616–1674) was the grea test builder of gardens in India. The famous\\ngardens of Kashmir, Shalimar, Anantnag and V e rinage owe their existence to him. In ancient India\\nmessages were given through religion to establish sound traditions based on the realization that partner-\\nship between the women and na ture ensured sustenance. Women were  therefore actively associated\\nwith tree culture and in many places trees like Pipal, Banyan, Gular, Siris, Sal, Ashoka, Aonla, Neem\\nand Shami (Prosopis cineraria) were worshipped. The leaves of Mango and Neem were considered\\nauspicious and leaves and flowers of Tulsi ( Ocimum sanctum) and Marigold were used for worship.\\nTulsi’ was the symbol of cosmos. All these tr aditions are practiced in India even today. The ancient\\nIndian civilization was primarily dependent upon and intimately related with forests and flora in San-\\nskrit scriptures (like Vrikshayurveda, Upavana vinoda, Brhat Samhita, etc.) the science of plant life has\\nbeen described and three indigenous fruits viz., mango banana and jackfruit are extensively mentioned.\\nArchaeobotanical indigence record wild date, jumbos, banana, jujube, apricot, breadfruit, etc. There\\nis a rich heritage of mango varieties in India. Mang o fruit had attracted the fancy of Moghul rulers\\nespecially there are choice varieties like Alphonso, Dashehari, Mulgoa, etc. In citrus natural interspecific\\nand intervarietal hybrids occur extensively in rootstock material which have been found to carry\\ntolerance to viruses and root diseases.

Kashyapa has advised four types of cultivation viz.,\\n(i) rice, (ii) pulses, (iii) vegetables and (iv) creepers and flowers. The farmers should cultivate delicious\\nvegetables like Jatika, Rasijatika, V alkika, Vana-vallika, Patolika, egg-plants, Savaka, pumpkin-gourd,\\nKalata, Kustumburu, Surana, Sakuta, and turmeric and ginger-both cultivated and wild-as well as\\nvarious other luscious plants for the sake of cooking. In the writer’s opinion these are the principal\\nvegetables. In some countries the varieties of vegetables are different depending on their species, shape,\\ntaste and colour. The cultivators should grow vine, Indian spikenard, cardamom, etc., in their respective\\nregions of cultivation. A Wiseman should grow indigenous vegetables on low as well as high land\\naccording to the season and country after learning the method of cultivation. Of the cultivable com-\\nmodities the varieties of paddy occupy the first place, the pulses the second, and the vegetables the\\nthird. In the fourth place come ghee, milk, curds, etc. These four kinds of products comprise the entire\\nfoodstuff. This stuff promotes the happiness of all the gods and is the means of sustenance of the whole\\nhumankind. This gives nourishment, health and long-life and was created by Brahma at the beginning\\nof creation all over the earth.\\nIn the spring, the summer and at some places in the dewy season the cultivation of vegetables is\\nsure to bring rich reward. The seeds of the egg-plant, V alli, Jatika, pepper, Savaka etc., dried in the sun\\nshould be sown in ploughed field for the sake of sprouting. The seeds of the egg-plant, etc., dried in the\\nsun, should be sown in the soil dressed with cow-dung, etc., for sprouting. They should be regularly\\nwatered and then covered with the straw-shed. In three days the sprouts appear in the depressions where\\nthe seeds were sown. After twenty days when the sprouts have taken firm roots, the wise cultivator\\nshould transplant them in a properly ploughed field. Watering the roots at that very time promotes the\\nlife of the plants.\\nThe cultivation of vegetables is good in low land in the summer and not in the rainy season. It is\\nsuccessful in other seasons also. In the same manner the bulbs of Sakuta, Surana and turmeric should\\nalso be implanted in hollow depressions or in a bed of hot soil and they will thrive. In this way, the\\ncultivation of creeping plants is manifold. Pumpkin-gourds, wild pumpkins, cardamom, spikenard and\\nagavalli (Piper Betel) may also be grown on high land. Of patolika, egg-plant, Saka (leafy vegetables),\\nand Savaka, the unripe young fruit is tasteful and is therefore, highly commended. He should cultivate,\\nnourish and protect the various sakas (pot herbs), which are fit for eating, sucking and chewing.\\nThe cultivators should after making depressions etc., in their various fields, cultivate seasonably in\\nspring, summer, rains, autumn, dewy season and winter pot-herbs and other vegetables whose leaves,\\nrind, flowers or bulbous roots are (edible and) delicious, nourishing and health-giving, and reap the rich\\nfruit of their labourers. They should grow, seasonably and according to usage, instructions of former\\nsages and the nature of the soil, cardamom, cloves, ginger, arecanut,  betel plant, sugarcane, plantain\\ntrees and other life-promoting and beneficial herbs like the long-pepper in their field-beds or on high\\nland (i.e., wet or dry land) as the case may be. The Brahmanas, Ksatriyas, V aisyas, Sudras, men of\\nmixed castes, hunters and soldiers ( vim) should all grow to their best efforts (coriander, surana, valli,\\npumpkin-gourd, and Patolika) in their own land of whatever sort it may be. Experienced cultivators\\ncarry out all the processes needed for the infixing of the seeds, weeding of the ill-growth and protection\\nof the plants till the time of inflorescence, under their own supervision according to the traditional\\nusage. Of these vegetables, leaves, flowers, fruit, unripe fruit or bulbous roots are taken for use either\\nat the beginning of efflorescence, or in the middle or end of it, as the case may be. The king should also\\nintroduce balances with a beam and scales made of bro n\\nze or brass for the weighing of vegetables.\\nWhatever help in the cultivation of food grains and vegetab les, etc., and in the procurement of oils,\\ncloth, etc., is recommended by former sages in their treatises that the king should render for the'),\n",

There are vivid descriptions of trees in the Rigveda\\n(3700–2000 B.C.). Methods of plant multiplication by seed and vegetative means were prevalent and\\nfind mention in the Vedas, Arthasasthra and Brhat Samhita. Plants were also featured in personal\\nadornment and beautification of the home. Girls wore flower to Champaka ( Michelia champaca) and\\njasmine in their hair and those of Siris (Albizzia labbek) in their ears. They made garlands of many kinds\\nof flowers and painted their foreheads and cheeks with sandal paste obtained from Santalam album.\\nPoet Kalidasa has made frequent references to these in his writings. In his Ritusamhara, Kalidasa gave\\ncharming descriptions of indigenous beautiful trees of India with flowers in different months. Accord-\\ning to Vatsyana all big houses and palaces of kings had to pleasure garden–vrksavatika and pushpavatika.\\nAmong the trees, one of the most beautiful was the red flowered Saraca indica popularly known as\\nAsoka. It was said that Sita was confined by Ravana in a grove of asoka trees. Another favourite tree\\nof those days was Kadama ( Anthocephalus cadamba) and its flower appears in golden balls. It was\\nclosely associated with the life of Lord Sri Krishna.\\nOf the climbers, Madhavilata ( Hiptage madhablata) received frequent mention in Kalidasa’s play\\n(5th century) and among sweet scented shrubs the mask-mallow ( Hibiscus abelmoschus ) and the\\ngarland flower ( Hedichium coronarium). Description of flowers and gardens and the garland flower\\n(Hedichium corononarium). Description of flowers and gardens had been presented in ancient Sanskrit\\nclassics like Rig V eda (3000–2000 B.C.), Ramayana (1200–1000 B.C.) and Mahabharata (500 B.C.).\\nOther Sanskrit books of early days written by Shudraka (100 B.C.), (Asvaghosha (100 A.D.) and\\nSarnghara (1283–1301 A.D.) also mentioned about flowers and gardens.

It is said that Lord Buddha was born under the papal tree in\\na garden. The planting of roadside avenue trees (margeshuvriksha) was an important contribution of the\\nking Asoka (233 B.C.).

Abu Zakriya says that all garden doorways should be farmed by clipped\\nevergreens, that cypresses should be used to line paths and grouped to mark the junctions of paths. He\\nobjected to the mixing of evergreen with deciduous trees. Plants named in his text include lemon and\\norange trees, pines and most of our common deciduous trees,  cypresses, oleander, myrtle and rose as\\nthe only flowering shrubs, violets, lavender, balm, mint, thyme, marjoram, iris, mallow, box and bay\\nlaurel. He lays much stress on ar omatics, as, indeed, did all the Islamic ga rdeners. His climbing plants\\nare vines, jasmines and ivy. The mahua (Madhuca indica) tree bears fruit twice a year and from its\\nkernels they make oil, which they use for lamps.\\nBetel vines - Ibn Battuta also saw betel vines in Kerala. He states, Betel-trees are grown like vines\\non cane trellises or else trained up coco-palms. They have no fruit and are grown only for their leaves.\\nThe Indians have a high opinion of betel, and if a man visits a friend and the latter gives him five leaves\\nof it, you would think he had given him the would, especially if he is a prince or notable. A gift of betel\\nis a far greater honour than a gift of gold and silver.\\nB.  European Period\\nMissionary priests, Englishmen, Portuguese, Amateur and professional gardeners from Europe, Asia\\nand Africa, introduced a large number of plants into Indian gardens. Portuguese introduced Agave\\namericana and Allamanda ca thartica, which have now been naturalized throughout India. Several\\nbotanical gardens were established during 18th and 19th centuries in various parts of India, where\\nindigenous and exotic plants were introduced and maintained . Roxburgh, the father of Indian Botany,\\nwas the first Botanist to adopt the Linnaean system of binomial nomenclature in relation to the plants\\nof India. His pioneering work, Flora indica, Plantae coromendelianae and his portfolio of paintings of\\n2,382 plants mainly the work of Indian artists formed the basis of Hooker’s ‘Flora of British India’.\\nPortuguese control the spice trade in the Indian Ocean during 1497 A.D. The term ‘herbal’ was put\\nin use in 1516 as per the Oxford English Dictionary. Robert Fortune (1852) sent tea plants from China\\nto Indian Himalayas.  Cinchona trees (for quinine) sent from Kew NBG to India in 1861.  One of the\\nimportant missionaries who introduced a number of exotic plants was Dr. Firminger, an Englishman'),\n",

When she was making rose water a scum formed on the surface of\\nthe dishes into which hot rose water was poured from the jugs. The scum was collected. It is of such\\nstrength in perfume that if one drop be rubbed on the palm of the hand it scents a whole assembly and\\nit appears as if many red rosebuds had bloomed at once. There is no scent of equal excellence to it. It\\nrestores hearts that have gone and brings back withered souls. In reward for that invention I presented\\na string of pearls to the inventories. Salima Sulthan Begam (may the lights of God be on her tomb) was\\npresent, and she gave this oil the name of “its-i-Jahangiri”.\\n2.41  MEDICINAL PLANTS AND THEIR RELEVANCE TODAY\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 80% of the population of developing countries\\nstill relies on traditional medicines, mostly plant drugs, for their primary health care needs. Also,\\nmodern pharmacopoeia contains at least 25% drugs derived from plants. Many other are synthetic\\nanalogues built on prototype compounds isolated from plants. Demand for medicinal plant is increasing\\nin both developing and developed countries due to growing recognition of natural products, being non-\\ntoxic, having no side-effects, easily available at affordable prices. There has been resurgence in the\\nconsumption and demand for medicinal plants. These plants are finding use as pharmaceuticals,\\nneutraceuticals, cosmetics and food supplements. A ccording to an all India ethno-biological survey\\ncarried out by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Gover nment of India, there are over 8000\\nspecies of plants being used for medicine in India.\\n2.42  THE SIDDHA SYSTEM OF MEDICINE\\nThe Siddha system of medicine owes its origin to the Dravidian culture, which is of the Pre-vedic\\nperiod. An examination of the ancient literature would reveal that the vedic Aryans owed allegiance to\\nthe cult of Shiva and the worship of the phallus (linga),  which was later on absorbed by, and incorpo-\\nrated into the V edic culture. The Shiva Cult is associated with its medical counterpart, the Siddha\\nsystem of medicine, which is mainly therapeutic. Mercury, sulphur, iron, copper, gold, bitumen, white,\\nyellow and red arsenic and other materia ls as well as vegetable poisons are extensively used in the\\npharmacopocia of the Siddha tradition. T he Siddha system of medicine is prevalent in the Southern\\nStates of India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Singapore, where the Dravidian civilization was document. In\\nthe North of India, the Siddhar-Kalpa system (Siddha means one who has attained immortality and\\nKalpa means panacea) is known as Tantric Science. Siddha Science considers nature and man as\\nessentially one. One who knows the anatomy of nature and its five elements knows well the anatomy\\nof men. Nature is the foremost physician. The Tamils who are inhabiting the Southern peninsula of the\\nsub-continent of India have an impressive and venerable past, as ancient as that of perhaps the\\nEgyptians. They undertook a systematic study of nature and its elements and from what they were able\\nto grasp, they had developed a highly systematized medicine, which is now known as Siddha system.'),\n",

Origin of Siddha Medicine\\nSiddha system is one of the oldest systems of medicine in India. The term ‘Siddha’ means achievement\\nand the ‘Siddhars’ were saintly figures who achieved results in medicine through the practice of Y oga.\\nEighteen ‘Siddhars’ seem to have contributed towards the development of this medical system. Siddha\\nsystem’s literature is in Tamil and it is practiced in Tamil speaking parts of India. The system is also\\ncalled Agasthiyar system in the name of its famous exponent sage Agasthya. A number of medical\\nworks of this system are ascribed to him but it may be difficult at this time to say the exact number that\\ncan be credited to him. This system of medicine developed within the Dravidian culture, which is of the\\npre-vedic period. The Siddha system is largely therapeutic in nature.\\nB.  The Siddhars\\nThe ancient Tamils in their quest for knowledge for longevity developed two ways by which man can\\nachieve mastery over nature. One is the Yogic way and the other is through medicines. The persons who\\ndedicated themselves to this task were themselves great yogis known as Siddhars. Hence the system of\\nmedicine propounded by them came to be known as Siddhars system of Medicine. This system can be\\ntraced to the prevedic period. Siddhar, a Tamil word that is derived from its root ‘chit’ means perfection\\nin life or heavenly bliss. It gene rally refers to eight kinds of superna tural powers attainable to man.\\nSiddhars are the persons who had attained such miraculous powers attainable to man. The persons who\\nhad attained such miraculous powers in life are known as Siddhars. They are men born with great\\ntalents who lived thousands of years ago in Tamil country, who by their devotion and search for truth,\\nachieved perfection in their life time.\\nC.  Ancient Siddha Medical Works\\nThe earliest mention the use of medicinal plants is to be found in Thirumular Thirumantiram-Ennayiram,\\nTholkappiam and the ancient Tamil works of Sangarm Literature, which are believed to have been\\nwritten thousands of years before the Christian era. T here are now more than 500 works in Tamil\\ndealing with various subjects such as science of life, nature of universe, astronomical data, cosmic\\ndance, atomic theory, space travel, alchemy, ‘Kaya Kalpa’ medicine, etc.\\nD.  The Neem Tree\\nThe Neem tree was regarded as sacred in Mohen-jo-daro Civilization. In the annals of the ancient\\nSiddha System of Medicine, the first medicinal plant mentioned as well as found a place, in ancient\\nTamil literature is Margosa or Neem. This has been used by Tamils from time immemorial as a deterrent\\nfor smallpox and other infectious diseases and also considered to possess powers to ward off evil spirits.\\nPerhaps they were aware of the germicidal action and the medicinal properties of the Margosa, Tirumular,\\nthe great siddha is said to have been in deep penance for several thousands of years before the Christian\\nEra in eternal bliss under a sacred pipal tree.\\nE. Basis of the Siddha System\\nAccording to Siddha medical science the universe consists of 5 elements. Earth, Water, Fire, Air and\\nEther which correspond to the five senses of the human body. Man consumes water and food, breathes\\nthe air and then maintains the heat in the body. He is alive because of the life force given by ether. The\\nearth is the first element, which gives fine shape to the body, including bones, tissues, muscles, skin,\\nhair etc. Water is the second element representing blood, secretions of the glands, vital fluid etc. Fire'),\n",

It also helps digestion, circulation\\nand stimulation besides respiration and the nervous system. Above all other is the characteristic of\\nman’s mental and spiritual faculties. A suitable proportion of these five elements in combination with\\neach other, produces a healthy person. These elements are divided into two halves, namely physical and\\nsubtle. And this subtle part is further sub-divided into two equal parts of which one is retained as such\\nand the other part is again subdivided into four equal parts. This is what is known in Siddha system of\\nMedicine as the theory of Panchikarnam (F ivefold combination). It is fact the functioning of the five\\nelements in the human body. The ideal of the unification of energy and matter and the synthesis of the\\nvarious phenomena of sound, light, heat, etc., which modern science has been endeavouring to establish\\nwere achieved by the ancient Siddhas, when modern equipments was not available for research. Siddhas\\nalso held that he who knows the secret doctrine of the five elements, could change a baser metal into\\ngold. And Siddhas alchemy is based on this theory.\\nKalpa Treatment - Ancient Siddha devoted time in finding out suitable remedies rather than\\ndescribing the causes of a disease in detail. The scope of ‘Kaya Kalpa’ treatment is two-fold; one is to\\ncure degenerative diseases and the other is to prolong the life span. Kalpa serves as an anti-degenerative\\nelixir—that can cure cancer and heart diseases is itself rejuvenation.\\nF.  Culture and History of Siddha Medicine\\nThe original home allotted to mankind by the Creator was in the temperate and fertile region of the East\\nand pointedly in India. It is from here that the human race began its culture and career.  India may,\\ntherefore, be safely stated as that the first country from which human culture and civilization originated\\nand spread. According to Indian history prior to Aryans migration, the Dravidian was the first inhabitant\\nof India of whom the Tamilians were the most prominent. The Tamilians were not only the earliest\\ncivilized but also those who may more considerable progress in civilization than any other early\\npeople. The languages of India were divided into two great classes, the northern with Sanskrit as the\\npre-pondering element and the southern with Dravidian language as independent bases. The science of\\nmedicine is of fundamental importance to man’s well being be and his survival and so it must have\\noriginated with man and developed as civilization. It is,  therefore, rather pointless to try to determine\\nthe exact point of time to which the beginning of these systems could be traced.  They are eternal; they\\nbegan with man and may end with him. The Siddha was flouriest in south and Ayurveda prevalent in\\nthe north. Instead of giving the name of any of individual as the founder of these systems our ancestors\\nattributed their origin to the crea tor.  According to the tradition it was Shiva who unfolded the knowl-\\nedge of Siddha system of medicine to his concert Parvati who handed it down to Nandi Deva and he\\nthe Siddhars. The Siddhars were great scientists in ancient times. \\nAccording to tradition, the origin of Siddha system of medicine is attributed to the great Siddha\\nAgastiyar.  Some of his works are still standard books of medicine and surgery in daily use among the\\nSiddha Medical practitioners. The science of medicine is of fundamental importance to man’s well\\nbeing and his survival, and so it must have originated with man and developed as civilization advanced.\\nIt is therefore rather pointless to try to deter mine the exact point of time when any system of medicine\\nwas evolved and codified. A system of medicine is not a discovery but a gradual evolution during\\nsuccessive periods of history. It owes its progress to great men, who have not only enriched the science,\\nbut also society and civilization as a whole.\\nThere are two ancient systems of medicine in India, the Siddha that flourished in the South and the\\nAyurveda prevalent in the North. Instead of giving the name of any one individual as the founder of\\neither system, our ancients wisely attributed their origin to the Creator. According to tradition, it was\\nShiva who unfolded the knowledge of Siddha system of medicine to his consort, Parvati, who handed'),\n",

Therefore, it is called ‘Saiva Sampradayam’ (tradition of\\nShive), or ‘Siddha Sampradayam’. In the case of Ayurveda it was Brahma, the Creator of the Universe,\\nwho taught the science to Prajapati, he to Aswini Devatas and they, in their turn, to Atreya etc. So this\\ntradition is called the Brahma or Arsha Sampradaya (the tradition of Rishis). The inference to be drawn\\nfrom these traditions is that, there is no exact point of time to which the beginning of these systems\\ncould be traced. They are eternal, without a beginning or end; they began with man. The Tamils have\\na distinct civilization, which is not disputed by histor ians. The recorded history of the Tamils is thou-\\nsands of years old. Apart from the literature of the first, the middle and the last Sangam periods, which\\nbears ample testimony to the extent of Tamil civilization and its eminence, mention is made even in\\ncontemporary Sanskrit literature about Cholas, Pandiyas and Cheras and their kingdoms. A civilized\\nsociety must naturally have had a system of medici ne, which catered to the health needs of its people.\\nThis was the Siddha system. The term ‘Siddhi’ means ‘achievement’ and the Siddhars were men who\\nachieved certain results in medicine, as well as in yoga or tapas. The results in medicine were achieved\\nby the Siddhars through their mental powers, they bequeathed to their ‘Chilas’ or pupils, who preserved\\nand propagated the science. Eighteen Siddhars seem to have existed. They should have lived at different\\nperiods and bequeathed their experiences in medicine and yoga to posterity. The names of these\\neighteen Siddhas differ from one source to another. It is not necessary to dogmatise which of these\\nenumerations is corr ect. Some of the Siddhas, for example, Kapila and Kakabujanda have written\\ntreatises both in Tamil and in Sanskrit. It is possible that the originals were written in Tamil and that they\\nwere translated into Sanskrit later. The following is the list of eighteen Siddhas according to one\\nrecession: 1. Nandi 2. Agasthiyar 3. Thirumular 4. Punnakkeesar 5. Pulasthiyar 6. Poonaikannar\\n7. Idaikadar 8. Bogar 9. Pulikai Isar 10. Karuvurar 11. Konkanavar 12. Kalangi 13. Sattainathar\\n14. Azhuganni 15. Agappai 16. Pambatti 17. Theraiyar and 18. Kudhambai. The names like Bogar,\\nIdaikadar and Theraiyar are of recent origin and these Siddhars lived probably in the middle ages.

Medical Education in Ancient India\\nMedicinal knowledge gained over trial and error over the thousands of years in India and neighbouring\\nregions has been systematized thousands of years ago in a system of medicine called Ayurveda. Ayurveda\\nis a Sanskrit word, derived from tw o roots: ayur, which means life, and Veda, knowledge. Knowledge\\narranged systematically with logic becomes science. During the due course of time, Ayurveda became\\nthe science of life. It has its root in ancient Vedic literature and encompasses our entire life, the body,\\nmind and spirit. In ancient India, Medical education was available in the larger cities such as Taxila,\\nKasi (Varanasi) and Nalanda. Taxila situated about 20 miles west of Rawalpindi (now in Pakistan) was\\nthe most important seat of learning in ancient India dating from the sixth century B.C. It attracted\\nstudents from all corners of India  viz., from Rajagriha, Mithila, Kashi, Ujjain, Kuru, Koshala, etc. Its\\nfame had spread far and wide in foreign countries; students from there were said to come here to learn.\\nNalanda was another center of learning, which flourished from the fifth to twelfth century A.D. The\\nplant wealth of forest was utilized through ‘Ayurv eda’ for the welfare of human beings. The most\\nimportant trees extensively used in medicinal preparations were Neem ( Azadirachta indica), Anola\\n(Phyllanthus officinalis), Harra (Terlllinalia chebula), Behda (Termlinalia bellirica), and Bael ( Aegle\\nmarmelos). The city of Ayodhya was inhabited by a good number of vaid yas or physicians. Proficient\\nand skilled surgeons known as ‘salyakrt’ (v. 28.6) existed at the time of Ramayana. Physicians accom-\\npanied royal well developed and surgeons were in  special demand. Surgeons of the structure of the\\nhuman body as can be inferred from the many anatomical terms used in the epic.\\nM.  Siddha Education\\nThere are two Government Siddha medical colleges with a total admission capacity of 150 students at\\nthe Under Graduate level. One at Palaya mkottai with admission capacity of 100 and the other at\\nChennai with an admission capacity of 50. In addition to the above another 3 private Siddha medical\\ncolleges are also there in Tamil Nadu with an admission capacity of 30 students each.  Admissions are\\npurely on the basis of Common Entrance Test conducted by the Govt. of Tamil Nadu after 10+2. These'),\n",

An international organization, called ICMAP (International Council for\\nMedicinal and Aromatic Plants) was initiated and located in Paris, France. The Government of Tamil\\nNadu has established the National Institute of Siddha at Tambaram, Chennai. This institute has teaching\\nfacility in 6 Siddha subjects as mentioned below:\\n– Siddha Maruthuvam - Pothu (General Medicine)\\n– Gunapadam (Pharmacology)\\n– Sirappu Maruthuvam (Special Medicine)\\n– Pillaippini Maruthvam (Paediatrics)\\n– Noi nadal  (Pathology)\\n– Nanju nool (Toxicology)\\nThe Central council of Indian Medicine regulates the education of Siddha system in the country.\\nWithin the council, there is a separate education committee for this system. The education committee\\nis charged to deal with all matters pertaining to Siddha education including the development of a\\ndetailed curriculum and syllabus both at under-graduate levels.\\n2.43 ROLE OF CATTLE AND OTHER DOMESTIC ANIMALS\\nA. Domestication of Animals\\nThe raising of animals is as old as civilization itself, for, our common domestic animals were domes-\\nticated before the beginning of written history. Paleolithic man hunted animals for food and raiment; his\\nsuccessor, the Neolithic man, tamed and confined them. It was in the Neolithic or New Stone age that\\nmen first practiced agriculture, which included the raising of domestic animals. Carbon-14 testing of\\nanimal and plant remains showed the domestication of sheep at 9000 B.C. in northern Iraq; cattle in the\\n6th millennium B.C. in northeastern Iran; goats at 8000 B.C. in central Iran; pigs at 8000 B.C. in\\nThailand or asses, at 7000 B.C. in Jarmo, Iraq; and horses at 4350 B.C. in Ukraine.  The domestication\\nof sheep and goat took place in the pre-agricultural phase when nomadic man with the help of dog\\nbrought them under his control. Small ruminants lik e sheep and goat constituted the important dietary\\nsource of the early man. This was probably the first step towards secured food production in his\\nadventurous life. The early man had the wisdom to distinguish between sheep and goat and their\\nvarying ecological requirements. The sheep is essentially a grass eater preferring protection of open\\nwoods. The goat is a browser preferring fo liage of shrubs and trees and is content with sparse forest.\\nTo the early man, sheep and goat provided milk, meat and clothing. Sheep scored over the goat in\\nrespect of wool and quality of meat while goat provided more milk.\\nAnimals like horses, elephants, camels, sheep, goats, bullocks, cows and buffaloes played vital role\\nin the development of human civilization from early time. The large ruminants like cows and buffaloes\\nwere wild animals of the forest and they used to invade the fields of river valley civilization as crop\\nrobbers. The early men judged the utility of these animals for power (energy), food (milk and meat),\\nmanure (dung and urine) and hide (shoes and shields). These crop robbers were, therefore, captured and\\ndomesticated to meet the day-to-day needs of life.'),\n",

Life Span of Animals\\nThe life span of some animals mentioned by Shalihotra is given below:\\nElephant 120 years\\nHorses 32 years\\nCows 24 years\\nAsses and camels 25 years\\nDogs 16 years\\nJackals 25 years\\nBees 14 days\\nC.  Livestock in Agriculture\\n“When Prajapati created cattle, he made them over to the Vaisya; and if a V aisya is willing to keep\\nthem, it must not be kept by any other caste.” ( Manu Samhita). Vaisyas were primarily agriculturists,\\nformed a wealthy and respectable section of the community and produced fine breeds of cattle. Agri-\\nculture, cattle rearing, trade and commerce constituted the four fold vartha or pursuits suitable for\\nmaking fortune. Cattle rearing have been noted in the Epics as important and universal an occupation\\nas farming in Ramayana and Mahabharata. The famous cow “Kamdhenu” (meaning producing accord-\\ning to desire) of Bashistha existed in Mahabharata. In the Mahabharata is given that lion, tiger, boar,\\nbuffalo, elephant, bear, and ape are the seven wild animals (aranyah); and cow, goat, sheep, horse, mule\\nand ass are seen domestic animals. Of the former group, boar , buffalo and elephant are reared. The\\nkings themselves, the Ksatriyas, owned and reared the cattle and cattle-wealth was the mainstay of their\\nhouse-hold finances. The outstanding examples are the emperor of Kosala (Ramayana) or of the prince\\nof Kasi (Jataka). The kings maintained buffaloes, camels, asses, mules, swine and dogs for a variety of\\npurpose (Arthasastra) besides horses, elephants, cows, sheep, and goats. In the Dhumakari Jatakti, the\\nhigh bred Brahmin is a goat keeper. The setthis or merchants mentioned in Jataka were also keeper of\\ncattle. The art of weaving gradually dev eloped and is considered as a further adaptation of basket\\nmaking from bamboo, which was a natural resource of the forest. The fibre used was the wool of sheep,\\nwhich was woven into carpets and fabrics f or garments. The Rigveda mentions about the fine quality\\nof wool of sheep and the domestication of the animal by the ‘Gandhars’ in the north-east of India.\\nThe V edic Aryans were primarily pastorals and grazed their cattle in the forests. The Kings were\\nrequired to make ample provision for pastures by setting apart suitable land at the time of forming\\nvillages. The Arthashastra mentions about the breeding policy for animals. It has also defined the duties\\nof graziers. The graziers were asked to attach bells to the necks of their cattle so as to scare away snakes\\nand tigers. The sound of the bell helped the graziers in locating the whereabouts of the herd. Cow was\\nthe principal wealth and symbol of Aryans and most of the wars were fought for acquiring cows. The\\ncows were milked three times a day and castration of bull was practiced. Zebu bull was the symbol of\\nGupta dynasty (240 B.C.). The coins during the Gupta period bore the image of ‘Nandi bull’, which is\\na humped Zebu. Improvement of Zebu cattle was the most important step taken by man in the\\ndevelopment of agriculture. The preference of Zebu for dry land and its aversion for water indicate its\\norigin in the dry mountainous environment. Similarly buffalo played an important role in the economy\\nof ancient India. In the Mauryan age, the buffalo became a recognized dairy animal. The female buffalo\\ngave plenty of milk and male was ideal for transport and for ploughing in the muddy rice-fields. One\\nof the centres of domestication of buffalo in India was the Indus valley. In India, buffalo is valued on'),\n",

Ghee is one of the important components of diet and widely used in religious func-\\ntions also. During the Mughal rule, large parts of the countr y were pastoral and rearing of sheep was\\na flourishing occupation of many people. Emperor Akbar (1555–1605) promoted the wool industry\\nparticularly related to the manufacture of ‘Shawls’ and carpets. Shawls made from ‘TUS’ were famous\\nfor lightness, warmth and softness.\\nD.  Breeding of Cattle\\nIn the Agnipurana we find the king enjoined to preserve the breed of cattle in the country. There were\\ncertain restrictions on castrating bulls. Emperor Asoka issued an order that a bull, a goat or a ram must\\nnot be castrated on the 8th, 10th, 15th and 13th day of each fortnight, neither on the Punarvasu day, on\\na festival day and in every fourth month of the year. A herd of 100 head of asses and mares shall contain\\nfive stallions, that of goats and sheep ten r ams, and those of cows, buffaloes and camels shall contain\\nfour breeding males each.\\nE.  Sacredness of Animals\\nThe cow is the foremost of all quadrupeds as surel y as the Brahmana is among the four castes. The\\ndeification of bull is considered as the animal of Siva. The Siva with his bull is represented in the coins\\nof the Kusanas and Scytho-Sassanian kings and in a coin of Sasanka, king of Gauda. But it is for the\\nfirst time and as late as in a coin of the Huna Mihiragula that a bull-emblem of Siva is seen with the\\nlegend. ‘Jayatu vrsah’ on the reverse. Touching a cow with feet is in (Ramayana and Mahabharata) is\\nto be read with the crimes indicated for cruelty to cows. Cows have been mentioned as a symbolical\\nrepresentation of the Earth rays of sun or the Goddess of speech. In the Matsya Purana, the earth is\\nrepresented as taking the form of a cow. At the r oot of the (cow’s) horn sits Brahma, in its middle sits\\nKesava (Lord Visnu) and at the end sits Siva–thus, the triad of gods resides there permanently. At the\\ntip of the (cow’s) horn are all the holy places as well as personages and all the gods reside in her body.\\nThus cow is the very embodiment of all the gods. At the top of her forehead resides the goddess\\n(Parvati), in her nostrils the god Kartikeya, and in her ears the two Naga (serpent) chief Kambala and\\nAsvatara. In the eye of that divine Surabhi (cow) and the sun and the moon, in the teeth the eight Vasus\\nand in her tongue sits the god Varuna. The Sarasvati resides in her lo wing, Yama and Yaksa (Kubera)\\non her temples, the risis (sages) in her pores and the water of the Ganges in her urine. The Yamuna\\nalong with other goddesses resides in her dung. Tw enty-eight crores of gods dwell in down.\\nF.  Dairying in Ancient India\\nIn the Indian mythology, the cow has been termed as the “mother” and the whole body of the cow has\\nbeen described as the permanent abode of various Gods and Goddess. Cow is the mother of Rudras,\\ndaughter of Vasus, sister of Aditi’s sons, and is “Ambrosia” in the form of ghee. Lord Krishna used to\\ncall his cows by name (a method of identification of animals). In Garg Samhita (Golok Khand) three\\ntitles, which used to be conferred upon persons possessing cowherds namely, ( i) Brakh Bhanu–the\\nperson who reared 10 lakh (one million) cows, ( ii) Nand-the person who reared 9 lakh cows and\\n(iii) Upnand–the person who reared 5 lakh cows.\\nRegarding the milk processing and its conversion into different products, sufficient evidence is\\navailable in the Mahabharata regarding items such as curd, butter and ghee, and these were prepared in\\nevery household. The traditional technology of milk heating (simmering), i.e., slows heating for a\\nlonger time on the fire of dried cow dung cakes is prevalent even today. The Westerners could know the\\nimportance of heating milk much later and the process of pasteurization came into being only after'),\n",

During the rainy season, autumn, and the dewy season they should milk the cattle both the\\ntimes (morning and evening); and during the winter, spring and summer, only once ( i.e., in the morn-\\ning). He who milks the cattle a second time during these seasons shall be punished by having his thumb\\ncut off. If he allows the milking-time to lapse, he shall forfeit his remuneration for that time. A ‘drona’\\nof a cow’s milk will yield one ‘prastha’ of ghee; the same quantity of buffalo’s milk will yield one-fifth\\nmore; and that goats and sheep will yield two-fifths more.\\nG.  Rearing and Care of Cows (Brhat Parasara Samhita)\\nThe householder should milk the cows in the morning as well as in the evening. They do not, as a rule,\\nmake increase in their yield of milk if the milking man is changed. The cow is the very congregation\\nof all the gods, for in her head sits the god Brahma, on her shoulders Siva, on her back Vishnu, tin her\\nfeet the V edas and whatever other gods are left, the y occupy every hair on her body. The Lord Hari\\n(Vishnu) is pleased with devotional attentions paid to her. A cow should not be milked without her calf,\\nnor when she is pregnant. One who milks her prior to ten days after her delivery, goes to hell.\\nH.  Therapeutic Aspects in Dairy\\nHuman milk has been considered as remedy for ‘7-f old doshas’. The milk of black complexioned\\nwomen is considered for the treatment of eye diseases whereas the milk of fair complexioned women\\nis used for the treatment of 3 doshas. The cow milk in general is strength giving. Milk of white cows\\ncures “Vaat” (rheumatic and cardiac complaints) and the milk of black cows cure kafa (lung infections).\\nThe milk of black teats possess highest medicinal value whic h no other kind of milk approach. Like\\nthis, there are many mentions of medicinal value of cow milk in Rigveda and Atharvaveda.\\nIn ancient medical treatise Charak Samhita, ten characteristic of cow milk, i.e., tasty, cooling, soft,\\noily, thick, mild, viscous, bulky, and resistant to external effects and has pleasant flavour have been\\ndescribed. Not only this, the morning cow milk (pratardoha) midday cow milk (saganv) and evening\\ncow milk (samandoha) possess different characteristics and properties. This type of analysis has been\\nmentioned in an old treatise ‘Bhava Prakash’ as under: Before-noon milk is appetizing, digestive and\\nimproving semen quality, at-noon milk gives str ength and destroys cough and liver ailments and\\nincreases hunger. In childhood it stimulates growth and in old ag e prevents wasting, and increasing\\nsperms by daily consumption in night the milk cures many diseases. Hence, milk can be consumed at\\nany time. In ‘Susruta Samhita’ the properties of cow milk and dahi (curd) have been described as\\nflavored, tasty, digestive, strength giving, restorative, pure and pleasant, and anti-rheumatic. Given with\\nequal proportion of honey, butter, peepal, dry ginger, black pepper, Vacha and rock salt (sendha namak)\\ntogether and mixed them with same quantity of cow curd, removes the ill effects of snake poison. The\\nmalai (thin accumulate on milk surface after heating) of milk has been known to possess immense\\ncapability of completely eradicating of ailments associated with the imbalances of V aat (rheumatic) and\\npitta (liver disorder) in addition to providing vigour and strength. Ancient literature states that there is\\na nerve in the spine of a cow termed as suryaketu which when exposed to sun synthesizes gold,\\nimparting anti-poisonous properties to the milk. This is cow ghee is supreme in characteristics. It cures\\nall the three doshas (imbalance of humours) and inacti vates toxins and improves eyesight.\\nI.  Animal Management\\nDuring post-Vedic era medicines occupied an honorable position and Samhitas by Charaka and shusruta\\nwere followed from about 700 B.C. At that time there was development of materia medica. The only\\nsource of use of indigenous drugs in veterinary medicine is Agni Purana, which reveals the real picture'),\n",

King\\nNala had a surname ‘Ashvavit, i.e., versed in the science of horses.

In the Mahabharata, Virata Parva, third PART, when the Pandavas entered into services of\\nKing Virata, Nakula declared himself well versed in the science of management and treatment of\\nhorses, and Sahadeva referred to his scientific knowledge about the cows. To Nakula is ascribed the\\nwork called Ashvachikitsa or “Treatment of diseases of the horse” which is still in existence. This book\\nis also called “Shalihotra”. In the Mahabharata, Virata Parva (PART III) Sahadeva, the fifth Pandava,\\nhas described himself as well versed in the science of management and treatment of cows. He also\\nmentions that he knows such type of cows and bulls whose urine when smelled by a barren woman, the\\nconception occurs (Mahabharata, Virat III.12). Perhaps the cow urine contains some type of hormone,\\nwhich needs to be investigated.

According to\\nan incomplete manuscript of Shalihotra (India Office Library, London), he is described as the father of\\nSusruta. Hastyayurveda or Gahayurveda is also an important branch of veterinary medicine. The source\\nof the science is Palakapya’s Hastyayurveda which is now available (Published in Anandashran\\nSanskrit Series, Poona, 1894). Susruta Samhita. Thus it may be assumed that this work also belongs to\\n1000 B.C.\\nKautilya, the prime minister of Chandragupta Maurya (325–260 B.C.) in his Artha-sastra refers to\\nthe duties of military surgeons to treat and protect the infantry horses and elephants from diseases,\\nepidemics, and food problems. The camel and the dog are conspicuous in royal stables and kennels (the\\nmention of dogs in royal house-hold is frequent in the Ramayana). The ducks are not seen in domestic\\nanimals. Cow, buffalo, goat and sheep were reared for dairy as well as for meat supply and skin. Swine\\nand fowl were meant entirely for consumption. The ox alone drew the plough. The bull, mule, ass and\\ncamel were used for draught (on rare occasions also horse and elephant (Arthasastra). The dog assisted\\nherdsmen to reconnoitre grazing forests (Arthasastra) or guarded royal apartments or served as hunting\\naccomplices to the king or nomadic huntsmen (Dasa brahmana Jataka). The hor se and elephant were\\nemployed according to their varied nature for draught riding and war. Animals used for draught\\npurposes were generally castrated and sometimes their horns were cut off (Mahabharat). The beasts,\\nwild and domestic yielded a large variety of animal produce  viz., skin, claw, horn, hoof, plume, tusk,\\nwool, etc.\\nEvery villager also used to keep a few animals for draught purposes or for doing or to meet the\\nsupply to his own household. The village maintained common on pay or on a share of produce,\\nshepherds, who were entrusted with the work of taking the animals to the pasture ground in the morning\\nand bring them back in the evening ( Anguttaranikaya; Rigveda). The Arthasastra rule requires of\\nHerdsmen is the knowledge to treat cow diseases and ford  them safely. The Arthasastra wants the best\\nherd to be entrusted for a fixed wage for other wise they may be spoiled by over milking. Herds of the\\nnext grade are surrendered for a fixed amount of dairy produce, viz., 8 varakas of ghee per year, which\\nthe owner will receive. Black, red or black and red bulls are, commended for yoking to the plough.'),\n",

For draught oxen and cows\\nyielding milk, the feed shall be provided in proportion to the duration of time the oxen are put to work\\nand the quantity of milk, which the cows yield.\\nK.  Protection of Cattle\\nCattle must be protected from brutes and thiev es. Instances of taking flesh except on ceremonial\\nfunctions are available in ancient literature. Taking of animal food is strictly forbidden in ancient laws\\nunder the threat of expiable sin and eternal perdition unless taken in conformity with the law, i.e., V edic\\nrites and sacrifices. Fines are enjoined for neglecting nasal perforation in proper time for stringing\\ndraught beasts to the yoke. Milking of cattle is allowed twice a day during the rains and the autumns,\\nbut in the dry winter and summer seasons only once on pain of the cowherd losing his thumb. Once in\\nsix months sheep and other animals shall be shorn of their wool. Stud bulls, bulls let out in the name\\nof village deity (gramadevavrsah) and cows within ten days of calving are exempt from penalization for\\ntrespass. Ropes and whips only are to be used in case of stray cattle and any injury to them incurs the\\npenalty for assault. Livestock is protected along with other properties of a householder by laws of torts.\\n“For causing pain with sticks, etc., to minor quadrupeds, one or two panas shall be levied; and for\\ncausing bleeding to the same, the fine shall be doubled. In the case of large quadrupeds not only double\\nthe above fines, but also an adequate compensation shall be levied. A person who himself kills or steals\\nthe cattle or instigates another to do so, should be punished with death.\\nL.  Indigenous Knowledge for Management of Livestock Diseases\\nIn ancient India people had sufficient knowledge of the diseases of farm animals and the methods of\\ncuring them. Vishnudharmottara Mahapurana (500–700 A.D.) contains information on the medical\\npractices of treating the diseased animals. Dipping the food of animals in its urine for the control of\\nfood and mouth disease. Dipping the tail in hot water or by applying powdered camphor for overcom-\\ning tail neurosis feeding ground neem leaves for internal parasites. Feeding sprouted whole wheat for\\n10–15 days continuously for anoestrus, etc.\\n1. Mastitis - Mastitis is caused by injury of the udder and by subsequent invasion by pathogens.\\nThe udder is inflamed and becomes hard. Sometimes a tumor is formed in the teats and during\\nmilking the animal feels severe pain and does not allow milking. For curing this disease the\\nlivestock owners follow mainly three practices. They either apply a mixture of ghee, sugar, and\\ncurd on the inflamed portion or sometimes milk froth around the teat. Both these practices\\naccording to scientists are effective as the ingredients used to act as soothing agents and soothe'),\n",

Another practice is to give hot bath to the affected animal. This helps\\nin reducing inflammation, pain, and swelling, and also increases blood circulation.\\n2. Foot-and-mouth disease - Foot-and-mouth is an acute infectious disease caused by a virus and\\noccurs in animals at any time round the year. The common symptoms of this disease are high\\nfever, sluggishness, smacking of the lips, abrupt reduction of milk yield, and abortions. For\\ntreating this disease the livestock owners follow many practices. They wash the affected portion\\nwith fitkari (alum). Alum acts as an antiseptic; it checks secondary infection by inhibiting\\npathogens. It is an astringent and also helpful in coagulation of blood. Sometimes the foot of\\nanimal is dipped in its urine as the latter has ger micidal property. Also, application of ground\\ncustard apple leaves or sprinkling camphor powder on affected area is practiced. Both act as a\\nfly-repellent, and are anti-inflammatory and give soothing effect. Sometimes the livestock\\nowners warm garlic pieces in hot mustard oil and after the oil cools, apply it on the affected area.\\nScientists opined that due to pungent smell it acts as a fly-repellent. It also acts as an antiseptic\\nand disinfectant. Another practice is to wash the affected area with hot water, as it has cauteri-\\nzation property, which is helpful in checking bleeding.\\n3. Tail neurosis - Tail neurosis is treated by dipping the tail of the animal in hot mustard oil or by\\napplying powdered camphor on the affected area. Both these practices are scientifically correct\\nas camphor acts as a fly-repellent whereas hot mustard oil is antiseptic, fly-repellent, irritant,\\nand also helpful in fast healing.\\n4. Pneumonia - The traditional treatment followed by villagers for curing pneumonia is to drench\\nlocal liquor 3–4 times a day and apply mustard oil on the chest of the affected animal. The\\ndisease symptoms are shivering and rise in body temperature. Both these practices provide\\nwarmth to the body and are helpful in eliminating cold from the body. Also, the animal is made\\nto inhale turpentine or eucalyptus oil. Inhalation of t he oil is effective in easing respiration.\\n5. Anoestrus - Anoestrus is a reproductive disorder where the animal does not have regular heat\\ncycle, Le., either it does not come in heat or remains continuously in heat thus prolonging\\ncalving interval. It may be due to hormonal imbalance or improper feeding or persistent corpus\\nluteum or presence of cyst in ovary thus hindering pr oper ovulation and heat cycle. For curing\\nthis disease, livestock owners follow mainly two practices, which are scientifically correct, i.e.,\\nthe animal is fed with a mixture of methi (Trigonellafoenum graceum), gur (Gaggery), and bajra\\n(Pearl millet). These substances act as stimulants and help in stimulating estrogen hormone.\\nAlso, sprouted whole wheat is fed for 10–15 days continuously. The sprouts are rich in vitamins\\nand minerals and thus help in increasing fertility.\\n6. Retained placenta - The indigenous practice followed by villagers is to drop the placenta by\\nhand with the help of experienced people. A ccording to scientists if the placenta does not fall\\nwithin 48 hours it must be dropped by hand. Another practice is to feed the animal its own milk.\\nAnimal milk is rich in calcium, vitamins etc. It helps in maintaining uterine tone, which is\\nhelpful in retention of placenta. Some villagers use ten mango ( Mangifera indica), leaves, two\\npieces each of jaiphal ( Myristica fragrans) and kaiphal ( Myrica magi). All these materials are\\nground and made into paste and then heated gently. The nearby area of vagina and thigh of the\\naffected animal is then massaged with the warm paste. The placenta is expelled from the uterus\\nwithin one hour of application. According to scientists, mango leaves have laxative and anti-\\nhemorrhagic properties. Both the properties are essential for the removal of placenta. Kaiphal\\nacts as antiseptic and farmers use it for the r emoval of placenta where presence of infective\\norganisms is always expected. Jaiphal works as febrifuge and narcotic.'),\n",

Diarrhea - Frequent expulsion of profuse loose watery bowel content is termed as diarrhea. This\\ncondition always involves abnormality in stomach and intestine. Farmers reported that they feed\\nthe mixture of mustard oil, water, and edible soda. Scientists considered the practice correct as\\nsodium bicarbonate balances pH of the body and wa ter helps to check the fluid loss.\\n8. Indigestion - The traditional treatment followed by villagers for curing this disease is to feed the\\nmixture of dhania (Coriandrum sativum) and jeera (Cuminum cyminum). These are carminatives\\nand help in easy digestion of food. Also, the animal is fed with overnight soaked mixture of\\nyellow mustard oil cake, jaggary, and salt after thorough cooking. Scientists reported that yellow\\nmustard oil cake is rich in calcium and phosphorus, which helps in secreting digestive juices and\\nincreasing enzymatic activity. Salt improves the secretion of digestive juices and jaggary pro-\\nvides energy. Black salt, jeera, adrak (ginger; Zingiber officinale) and garlic paste is given to the\\nanimal. These substances increase the appetite by increasing motility of intestine and help in\\nrapid digestion. Black salt is a mild laxative.\\n9. Tympany - The traditional practice followed by farmers for treating tympany is to feed turmeric\\npowder in curd; ajwain ( Trachyspemum ammi), and salt in water; mixture of ajwain, heeng\\n(asafoetida), garlic salt, methi, and turmeric; and garlic and ginger paste with common salt and\\nmustard oil. Scientists opined that all these substances are carminative and antiflatulent, help in\\nimproving appetite, and do not cause constipation. Another practice followed is to make the\\nanimal to run fast as it helps in expulsion of gases.\\n10. Hemorrhagic septicemia - Hemorrhagic septicemia is an infectious disease, usually acute in\\nnature caused by bacteria (Pasteurella multocaeda) and affects mostly cattle and buffaloes. The\\ninformants mentioned that they give hot ash massage to the affected animal. The scientists\\nreported that this practice is helpful in reducing inflammation and swelling.

Use of Animals Flesh as Human Food\\nThe usefulness of cattle in India for power, food and manure was fully realized with the development\\nof agriculture. The earlier practice of animal sacrif ice was given up under the influence of Buddhism\\nand bullocks became the companion of man in the conquest of virgin lands. Indian farmers regard cattle\\nas members of their own social group and treat them with reverence on different occasions during the\\nyear. The virtues of ahimsa and abstention from meat-diet are followed by exceptions made in favour\\nof sacrifice and hunting for the royal race in the Maba bharata. Buddha himself allows fish and flesh to\\nhis disciples. Strabo’s remark on Megasthenes authority that the Brahmanas “eat flesh but not that of\\nanimals employed in labour”, whatever truth it may contain, reflects at any rate a sound economic sense\\nwhich in some quarter regulated animal diet. Animals are to be slaughtered for flesh only in the abattoir\\n(parisunam) on pain of fine. The varieties of animal flesh were also disposed of from separate stalls in\\nthe market place and different sets of stockists and butchers throve on them;  e.g., the cattle-butcher,\\nsheep-butcher, pig-sticker, fowler, deer-stalker, etc. In its rules on cow slaughter, the Arthasastra wants\\nthe immunity of only calves, milch cows and stud bulls. In the Satapatha Brahmana, Y ajnavalkya is fond\\nof tender beef. According to Panini ‘goghna’ means a ‘guest’ because a cow is killed for him. Apastamba\\npermits the slaughter of a cow at the reception of a guest, at the worship of the manes and at nuptial\\ncelebrations (Grhyasutra; Manu). In Bhavabhuti’s Uttararamacarita a heifer is stated to be slain by\\nV almiki in honour of V asistha’s visit to his asrama. According to the Dasabrahmana Jataka, Slaughter\\nof ox for flesh was very common and there were special slaughter-houses for beef. Even cows did not\\nnecessarily find exemption. In a Vinaya list of unpalatable and inedible food to which the people fell\\nonly in famine, occur, elephant, horse, dog and snake. Fowl, swine and cow never come in the list of\\nanimals and birds forbidden even for the Brahmana’s table. Beef and ham are classed among non-\\nedibles. High-crested cocks born of Vrtra’s blood (sikhandah) occur as non-eatable to the twice-born\\nand the initiated in the Mahabharata. Cocks and pigs occur in an exhaustive list of animals prohibited\\nfor the Snataka Brahmana in Gaut. XXIII. 5 and Manu. In the Ramayana cow-killing and milking a cow\\njust delivered are sins.\\nN.  Use of Cow Dung as Plant Food\\nIf one wishes the prosperity of his cattle, one should not even by mistake allow the cow dung to be\\nremoved on Sundays, Tuesdays and Saturdays.

The removal of cow dung on Tuesdays and Saturdays is detrimental to cattle. A\\nsuccessful cultivator should worship the heap of cow dung in the month of Magha, ‘and on an auspi-\\ncious day he should turn up the manure with spades. Reducing the manure, which is drying in the heat\\nof the sun, into, the powder, should deposit it in pits, in each field in the month of Phalguna. Then at\\nthe time of sowing, he should dress the field with manure or without manuring the crop neither thrives\\nnor yields fruit.\\n2.44 DESCRIPTION OF INDIAN CIVILIZA TION AND AGRICULTURE\\n2.44.1 Indus Valley Civilization\\nAllchins, relying on Lambrick, who, according to them, had personal knowledge of Sind, describe as\\nfollows how crops were grown in the riverain tract of the Indus. “The principal food grains, that is\\nwheat and barley, would have been grown as spring ( rabi) crops: that is to say, sown at the end of the\\ninundation upon land which had been submerged by spill from the river or one of its natural flood\\nchannels, and reaped in March or April. In modern practice such land is neither ploughed nor manured,\\nnor does it require additional water. Lambrick remarks that ‘the whole operation involves an absolute\\nminimum of skill, labour and aid of implements. Other crops, including cotton and sesamum, would be\\nsown as autumnal (kharif) that means they would be sown at  the beginning of the inundation and\\nharvested’ at its close, in autumn. For this fields surrounded by earth embankments would be required,\\nmost probably along the banks of natural flood channels. Although this method is more precarious than\\nthe former, both exploit the natural fertility of the alluvium, and the annual inundation. Both systems\\nare still in use. According to my experience of cultivation in the riverain areas of the Punjab, when the\\nland has appropriate moisture, land is ploughed, seed is sown and the soil is smoothened with a plank.\\nThe practice followed by the Harappans could not have been different. For the proper sowing of crops,\\nsoil has to be stirred and seed has to be covered.\\nAlexander and his successors and Megasthenes set the stage in the history of Greek presence in\\nIndia and the ‘Indica of Megasthenes’ analyzes the Greek account of India. Seleucus was the ambas-\\nsador to Chandragupta Maurya. The book covers the history of the Greek kingdoms and northern India\\nand the development of the Indian Ocean trade. Sandwiched between these two historical sections lies\\nthe core of the book: two massively detailed PARTs surveying Greek knowledge of India. The first\\ndeals with the physical geography of India, its h ydrology and meteorology, and the second with the\\nnatural history of the subcontinent including its biology and geology and their m ilitary, commercial,\\nand even medical implications. Megasthenes states that Maurya officers were concerned with the\\nmeasurement and supervision of alluvial deposit for revenue purpose.\\nThe Greek writers highl y praised the fertility of Indian soil and favourable climate condition and\\ninner-system while describing the principal agricultural products of the land. Since there is double\\nrainfall in the course of each year, one in the winter season, when the sowing of wheat takes place as\\nin other countries, and the second at the time of the summer solstice which is the proper season for\\nsowing rice and ‘bosporum’, as well as sesamum and millets-the inhabitants of India almost always\\ngather in two harvests annually (Diodorus, II. 36). The Greek writers also affirm that India has a double\\nrainfall and the Indians generall y gather two harvests-Me gasthenes witnesses-the sowing of wheat in\\nearly, winter rains and of rice, ‘bosporum’, sesamum and millets in the summer solstice (Diodorus, II,\\n36). Megasthenes adds further to the winter crops, viz., “wheat, barley, pulse and other esculent fruits\\nunknown to us”.\\n1.

Abu Zakariya\\nsays that all garden doorways should be farmed by clipped evergreens, that cypresses should be\\nused to line paths and grouped to mark the junctions of paths. He observed an object to the\\nmixing of evergreen with deciduous trees. He observed loss of water through evaporation. Plants\\nnamed in his text include lemon and orange trees, pines and most of our common deciduous\\ntrees, cypresses, oleander, myrtle and rose as the only flowering shrubs, violets, lavender, balm,\\nmint, thyme, marjoram, iris, mallow, box and bay laurel. He lays much stress on aromatics, as,\\nindeed, did all the Islamic gardeners. His climbing plants are vines, jasmines and ivy.\\n2. Babur-NAMA - An Autobiography and a Book on Natural History: Babur-nama reflects the\\ncharacter and interests of the author, Zehir-ud-din Muhammad Babur. Babur, the founder of the\\nMughal dynasty in India, is regarded as one of the most romantic and interesting personally ties\\nof Asian history.\\n3. Alberuni (Abu Raihan Muhammed bin Ahmed), a Central Asian scholar, with keen perception,\\ncame to northern India early in the eleventh century, and made a remarkable observation on the\\nstructure and formation of the Indo-Gangetic alluvium. “If you have seen the soil of India with\\nyour own eyes and meditate on its nature,” wrote Alberuni, ‘if you consider the rounded stones\\nfound in the earth, however deeply you dig , stones that are of smaller size at greater distance\\nfrom the mountains, and where the streams flow more slowly, stones that appear pulverized in\\nthe shape of sand where the streams begin to stagnate near their mouths and near the sea, if you\\nconsider all this, you could scarcely help thinking that India has once been a sea which by\\ndegrees has been filled up by the alluvium of the streams.’\\nProtection of cultivators - Sher Shah had genuine concern for the peasantry and safety of their\\ncrops. Abbas Khan states, One of the regulations Sher Shah made, was this: That his victorious\\nstandards should cause no injury to the cultivations of the people; and when he marched he\\npersonally examined into the state of the cultivation, and stationed horsemen round it to prevent\\npeople from trespassing on anyone’s field. I have heard from Khan-i-Azam Muzaffar Khan, who\\nsaid he often accompanied Sher Shah, that he used to look out right and left, and (which God\\nforbid) if he saw any man injuring a field, he w ould cut his ears with his neck, would have him\\nto be paraded through the camp. And if farm the narrowness of the road any cultivations was\\nunavoidably destroyed and give compensation in money to the cultivations. If he enters an\\nenemy’s country, he did not enslave or plunder the peasantry of that country nor destroy their\\ncultivation. ‘For, said he, the cultivators are b lameless, they submit to those in power; and if I\\noppress them they will abandon their villages, and the country will be ruined and deserted, and\\nit will be a long time before it again becomes prosperous.\\nAs regards the peasantry and their condition, there is reliable evidence in the observations of the\\nEuropean travellers who travelled in India in the seventeenth century. Peter Mundy tells us that\\nthe peasants near Agra were treated ‘as Turks treat Christians’, ‘taking from them all they can\\nget by their labour, leaving them nothing but their bad, mud-walled, ill-thatched houses and a\\nfew cattle to till the ground, besides other miseries.’\\nPelsaert, who was in Agra during the rule of Jahangir, observed: ‘The land would give a'),\n",

Some peasants abscond to escape\\ntheir tyranny, and take refuge with rajas who are in rebellion, and consequently the fields lie\\nempty and unsown, and grow into wildernesses. Such oppression is exceedingly prevalent in this\\ncountry.’ Bernier, commenting on the state of the northern part of the country, its agriculture and\\npeasantry, states: ‘Of the vast tracts of country constituting the empir e of Hindustan, many are\\nlittle more than sand, or barren mountains, badly cultivated, and thinly peopled; and even a\\nconsiderable portion of the good land remains untilled from want of labourers, many of whom\\nperish in consequence of the bad treatment they exper ience from the Governors. These poor\\npeople, when incapable of discharging the demands of their rapacious lords, are not only often\\ndeprived of the means of subsistence, but are benefit of their children, who are carried away as\\nslaves. Thus it happens that many of the peasantry, driven to despair by so execrable a tyranny,\\nabandon the country and seek a more tolerable mode of existence, either in the towns or camps,\\nas bearers of burdens, carriers of water, or servants to horsemen. Sometimes, they fly to the\\nterritories of a Raja, because there they find less oppression, and are allowed a greater degree of\\ncomfort.\\n4.

Abdul Razzak observed that chewing of pan (betel leaf) was\\na common practice at Vijiayanagar, and he attributes virility of the king to its stimulating\\nproperties.\\n5. Quest for Spices (1498–1580 A.D.): The Europeans had to pay extortionate prices for species,\\nparticularly pepper, which not only made their food tasty, but was also used as a preservative for\\nmeat. Pepper was also used in wine and pastry.\\n6. Domingo Paes, a Portuguese merchant, who visited Vijiyanagar in A.D. 1520.

Stevens is famous as the first Englishman known to have set foot on Indian soil. Born in\\nWiltshire and educated in Winchester, he made his way to Rome and there entered the Jesuit\\norder. Being desirous of serving in India, he obtained a passage at Lisbon in the spring of 1579\\nand reached Goa in October of that year. He was the first European to make a scientific study\\nof Konkani, and he wrote two religious works, one of which was a long epic in Marathi. Describ-\\ning a visit to Malabar he mentions a number of crops including pepper and coconut. “Here\\ngrows the pepper; and it springs up by a tree or a pole, and is like our ivy berry, but something\\nlonger, and at the first the bunches are green, and as they wax ripe they Cut them off and dry\\nthem. The leaf is much lesser than the ivy leaf and thin to zero. All the inhabitants here have very\\nlittle houses covered with the leaves of the coco-trees. All the pepper of Calicut and coarse\\ncinnamon grows here in this country. The best cinnamon comes from Ceylon, and is pilled from\\nthe young trees. Here are very many palm or coco-trees, which is their chief food; for it is their\\nmeat and drink, and yields many other necessary things.'),\n",

Jeane-Baptiste Tavernier, a French jeweller and merchant, visited India six times, between the\\nyears 1638 and 1688. He corroborates the account given by Bernier. He states: ‘The peasants\\nhave for their sole garment a scrap of c loth to cover those parts which natural modesty requires\\nshould be concealed; and that they are reduced to gr eat poverty, because if the Governors\\nbecome aware that they possess any property they seize it straightaway by right or by force. You\\nmay see in India whole provinces like deserts from whence the peasants have fled on account\\nof the oppression of the Governors.’ The flight of peasants from the land intensified during the\\nreign of Aurangzeb. With the decrease in the number of peasants, the income of the assignees,\\nthe jagirdars, was reduced. The jagirdars, to make good their loss, put increased pressure on the\\nworking peasants. Moreover, the practice developed of selling governments of provinces for\\nimmense sums in hard cash. Hence, it naturally became the principal object of the individual\\nthus appointed Governor, to obtain repayment of the purchase-money, which he had borrowed\\nat a ruinous rate of interest. This in tu rn resulted in more repression on the cultivators.\\n10. Betel vines: Ibn Battuta also saw betel vines in Kerala. He states, Betel-trees are grown like\\nvines on cane trellises or else trained up coco-palms. They have no fruit and are grown only for\\ntheir leaves. The Indians have a high opinion of betel, and if a man visits a friend and the latter\\ngives him five leaves of it, you would think he had given him the would, especially if he is a\\nprince or notable. A gift of betel is a far greater honour than a gift of gold and silver.\\nEvidence of the structure of the Mughal gardens and plants grown in them is in the Persian\\nclassics illustrated during the reign of Akbar. Among them is Diwan-i-Anwari, a collection of\\npoems by the Persian poet Anwari, who flourished in the latter part of twelfth century. It contains\\nsome excellent paintings on gardens and gardening. Abu-l-Fazl mentions three kinds of sugarcane,\\nviz., paunda, black and ordinary. Abu-l-Fazl provides a list of twenty-one fragrant flowering\\nplants along with the colour of their flowers and the season of flowering in the Ain-i-Akbari.\\nAfter describing the indigenous flowering trees and shrubs, Abu-l-Fazl mentions the names of\\nthose introduced from foreign countries. Abu-l-Fazl mentions that Akbar imported gardeners’\\nfrom Iran and Turan. Abu-l-Fazl provides a detailed account of fruits grown in India during the\\nreign of Akbar in the Ain-i-Akbari. ‘His Majesty looks upon fruits as one of the greatest gifts of\\nthe Creator, and pays much attention to them,’ states Abu-l-Fazl. ‘The horticulturists of Iran and\\nTuran have, therefore, settled here, and the cultivation of trees is in a flourishing state.’ ‘Melons\\nand grapes have become very plentiful and excellent; and water melons, peaches, almonds,\\npistachios, pomegranates, etc., are everywhere to be found. Abu-l-Fazl mentions the names of\\neighteen vegetables and the seasons in which they were grown. Food and fodder for royal horses\\nwas standardized. Abu-l-Fazl states, ‘In winter, they give boiled peas or vetch; in summer, grain.\\n‘The betel leaf is, properly speaking, a vegetable, but connoisseurs call it an excellent fruit,’\\nstates Abu-l-Fazl. ‘The eating of the leaf renders the breath agreeable, and repasts odorous. It\\nstrengthens the gums, and makes the hungry satisfied, and - the satisfied hungry. I shall describe\\nsome of the various kinds. 1. The leaf called Bilahri is white and shining, and does not make the\\ntongue harsh and hard. It tastes best of all kinds. After it  has been taken away from the creeper\\nit turns white, with some care, after a month, or even after twenty days when greater efforts are\\nmade. 2. The Kaker leaf is white with spots, and full, and has hard veins. When much of it is\\neaten, the tongue gets hard. 3. The Jaiswar leaf does not get white, and is profitably sold mixed\\nwith other kinds. 4. The Kapuri leaf is yellowish, hard, and full of veins, but has a good taste and\\nsmell. 5. The Kapurkant leaf is yellowish-green, and pungent like pepper; it smells like cam-\\nphor. You could not eat more than ten leaves. It is to be had at Banaras; but even there it does'),\n",

George Nathaniel\\nCurzon succeeded Lord Mayo as Viceroy of India. The horrors of Famine (1889–90) convinced Lord\\nCurzon that urgent attention must be paid to agriculture. Lord Curzon passed the Land Alienation Act\\n(1900) and Cooperative Societies Act (1904). Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India with the generous\\ndonations from Henry Phipps of the USA had founde d the Imperial Agriculture Research Institute in\\n1905 at Pusa, a village in the Darabhanga district of Bihar. The main building at Pusa was named after\\nits donor as the Phipps Laboratory. [PUSA stands for the donor of the Institute, Phipps of the USA].\\nThere was a disastrous earthquake in 1936 and Pusa suffered heavily. After careful consideration the\\nGovernment of India rebuilt the institute at New Delhi. The transfer to New Delhi was completed by\\nOctober 1936. The Marquees of Linlithgo, the then Viceroy of India, opened this Institutes in\\nNovember 1936. This Institute (IARI) in Delhi is popularly known as the Pusa Institute. Under the\\nUniversity Grants Commission Act 1956, the Institute (at New Delhi) got the status of the Deemed\\nUniversity and Teaching and Research activities were intensified from 1958. In 1947, India had about\\n27 Agricultural and Veterinary Colleges including the Indian Agricultur al Research Institutes, Indian\\nV eterinary Research Institute and five other Agricultural Colleges established during the first decade of\\nthe century. These Colleges were purely teaching institutions affiliated to traditional universities and\\ncontributed little to research. Agriculture Colleges were started at Poona (Pune) and Kanpur. Teaching\\nwas the main mandate. The Ci vil V eterinary Department was established in 1889, the main attention\\nwas on horse and male breeding. Systematic investigation on animal breeding began in 1890 with the\\nImperial Bacteriologist at the College of Science, Poona. Which was shifted to Mukteswer where the\\nImperial Bacteriologist Laboratory was established in1895. This institution has been pioneer in the field\\nof V eterinary research in the Countr y.

It is an essential step in building a political consensus on a broad national\\ndevelopment strategy, which encompasses, inter-alia, the roles and responsibilities of different agents\\nin the economy, such as Central, State and local government, the private corporate sector, the small and\\ntiny sector, people’s organization etc. It must identify potential risks and bottlenecks and their possible\\nsolutions in order to mobilize efforts in a focused manner. It is clear, therefore, that to meet these\\nobjectives, a vision statement has to operate at several levels of generality and specificity. A vision is\\na picture of what is possible or what is desired in a longer-term future. It could be of one individual in\\norigin or it could be a collective in its conception.\\nPresident A.P .J. Abdul Kalam’s address to the joint session of Parliament in 2003: The people to\\nstrive towards the goal of transforming India into a Developed Nation by 2020. This vision captures our\\npeople’s heightened self-confidence, rooted in India’s impressive achievements in many fields. It also\\nreflects the increased expectations of our people at the beginning of the new century, that India no\\nlonger be categorized as a developing, much less, a poor country.

Hence, it is time\\nIndia launched a new vision, which I would call “Vision–2020”. To achieve this, they should concentrate\\non two mantras: Effective Implementation with People’s Participation; and Effective Communication\\nfor People’s Participation. A key element of “Vision 2020” would be “Providing Urban amenities in\\nRural Areas (PURA)”. More than two-thirds of India’s population lives in rural areas. We need to give\\na new thrust to their all-round development through a mega mission for their empowerment. The\\nrichness and diversity of India’s bio-resources are a major gift of nature to us. The Biological Diversity\\nBill 2002, passed in the Winter Session, marked a major milestone in India’s commitment to conservation\\nand sustainable utilization of our bio-resources. An ambitious afforestation programme with people’s\\nparticipation that establishes Joint Forest Management Committees in all the 1.73 lakh villages located\\non the fringes of the forest areas has been launched. The scope of the National River Conservation Plan\\nhas been considerably broadened to include works in 155 towns along polluted stretches of 29 rivers\\nspread over 17 States. India successfully hosted the Eighth Conference of Parties to the United Nations\\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in New Delhi last year. The successful adoption of the\\nDelhi Declaration helped to raise awareness of developing country concerns in climate change. India\\nwelcomes the adoption of the Plan of Action at the World Summit on Sustainable Development, which\\nwas held in Johannesburg last year. India’s first meteorological satellite was successfully launched. The\\nforthcoming launches of satellites in the INSAT-3 series will add further capacity to the INSAT system,\\nwhich is already one of the largest domestic communication satellite systems in Asia. An exclusive\\nsatellite for education, EDUSAT, is also under development. ISRO has taken up the task of tele-medicine\\nconnectivity to provide medical services to remote areas. The Indian Remote Sensing Satellites continue\\nto provide valuable data for our resources survey and management. Groundwater prospect maps for six\\nStates were released recently to help locate sites for drilling bore wells.\\nThe Nation has been searching for a lasting solution to the recurring problem of droughts and\\nfloods, which have been t aking a huge human and economic toll. Networking of our river systems to\\ntransfer water from the surplus basins to t he areas of deficit has engaged people’s attention for many\\ndecades. The Government has set up a Task Force to prepare a practical b lueprint for this project,\\nwithout compromising environmental safety and the interest of displaced people. This initiative will\\nbring significant benefits in drinking water, irrigation, power generation, inland navigation, and tourism.\\nI must emphasize that this mega project does not negate the need for promoting small and micro\\nprogrammes for water conservation at local levels. The two are mutually complementary. The National\\nWater Resources Council has adopted a new National Water Policy emphasizing integrated water resources\\ndevelopment and management for optimal and sustainable utilization of available surface and\\ngroundwater. The Centre has launched a Fast Track Programme for the completion of those major and\\nmedium irrigation schemes that can be completed in one year. Subsequent to the approval by the\\nNarmada Control Authority, the dam height was raised, and this has mitigated the problem of drinking\\nwater and irrigation in arid areas of Saurashtra and No rth Gujarat. The policy of procurement at the\\nMinimum Support Price, while ensur ing remunerative prices for w heat and rice farmers in surplus\\nStates, has resulted in huge stocks of rice and wheat with the public agencies. As a response to this, the\\nGovernment has been encouraging exports of food grains. The wide-ranging recommendations on\\nlong-term food management made by the High Level Committee are being examined. There is an\\nurgent need to review the current policies, which have impeded crop diversification and led to\\nunsustainable food subsidies, and to ensure crop neutral support to our farmers without excessive\\nprocurement. Fertilizers are a critical component in our scheme of food security. The new pricing policy'),\n",

National Textile Policy\\nDeciding to redefine the goals and objectives, focus on thrust areas and sharpen strategy in tune with\\nthe times, the National Textile Policy–2000 is enunciated as follows: The Indian Textile Industry shall\\nbe the policy to produce cloth of good quality at acceptable prices to meet the growing needs of the\\npeople; increasingly contribute to the provision of sustainable employment and the economic growth of\\nthe nation; and compete with confidence for an increasing share of the global market. The strategic\\nthrust areas will be on technological upgradation, enhancement of productivity, quality consciousness,\\nstrengthening of the raw material base, product diversification, increase in exports and innovative\\nmarketing strategies, financing arrangements, maximizing employment opportunities and integrated\\nhuman resource development. The important endeavour will be to achieve increase in cotton\\nproductivity by at least 50% and upgrade its quality to international standards, through effective\\nimplementation of the Technology Mission on Cotton; launch the Technology Mission on Jute to\\nincrease productivity and diversify the use of this environment-friendly fibre; strengthen and encourage\\nthe handloom industry to produce value added items and assist the industry to forge joint ventures to\\nsecure global markets; facilitate the growth and strengthen HRD Institutions including NIFT (National\\nInstitute of Fashion Technology) on innovative li nes; review and revitaliz e the working of the TRAs\\n(Textile Research Associations) to focus research on industry needs.

Agricultural Extension in India\\nThe farming community needs to increase their productivity through the mission Second Green Revo-\\nlution using technological advances. Also dry land cultivation needs a thrust. The technology is the base\\nitem for the action plan to bring India into a developed nation in reality. Grooming ‘technology’ from\\nseed up to a fruit-bearing tree is an art, science and a specialized enterprise in itself. The key to success\\nlies in assessing where, when and ho w to facilitate entry for mone y in the process of technological\\nproject realization. There are many other prior activities, which need to be done if technology develop-\\nment can mature into a good business activity. Another important development was that in addition to\\nrapid spreading of interest within the actual farmers, the whole community (in the benefited areas) got\\ninvolved. For example, a women ‘Self Help Group’ is being formed for certain joint cooperative efforts\\nfor better quality of life.\\nFarmers get considerable earnings (and substantial returns on their investment in Agro processing)\\nper hectare.

Such features or fe ature may allow the plants to make fuller use of nutrients,\\nwater, temperature or light available or may give protection against adverse factors such as temperature\\nextremes, harmful insects and diseases. Adaptation may be morphological or physiological.\\n(a) Morphological adaptation such as growth habit, strength of stalk, radial symmetry, or rhizomes.\\n(b) Physiological adaptation, which result in resistance to parasites, greater ability to compete for\\nnutrients or ability to withstand desiccation. However both morphological and physiological\\nadaptation represents the expression of physiological processes.\\n3.2.2 Principles of Plant Distribution\\nEnvironmental factors are highly influential in determining the natural distribution of plants.\\nThere are eight principles of plant distribution\\n\\x7f Evolution\\n\\x7f Climatic factors like light, temperature, moisture, wind etc.\\n\\x7f Edaphic factors like soil, parent material, physiography\\n\\x7f Dispersal of flora'),\n",

Many tropical crops such\\nas rubber, cocoa, banana will not with stand freezing temperature (0°C). In these rubber probably has\\nthe narrowest tolerance range and banana the widest range for temperature tolerance.\\nTheory of avoidance - It may be accomplished through rapid completion of the life cycle, as in\\nephemerals, dormancy in seeds to avoid effects of the hottest and driest periods, dormancy in vegetative\\nparts or roots of all the perennials, water accumulation in succulents and extremely deep root systems\\nto avoid moisture deficiency.\\nTheory of factors replaceability - One factor that can be replaced by another or substituted by another.\\nFor e.g.,\\n\\x7f Elevation can be substituted for latitude because of its temperature effects. The climatic\\nconditions at the latitudes of 35–45° N r esembles to that of tropical regions at elevation of\\n4000–6000 ft.\\n\\x7f The angle direction of slope may be substituted for latitude. This is also a temperature adjust-\\nment, depending on the angle of exposure to solar radiation, wind etc.\\n\\x7f Parent materials may compensate for climate.\\n\\x7f Rainfall may be replaced by fog and to some extent by dew.\\n\\x7f Soil texture ma y be substituted for moisture.\\n3.2.4 Major Crops of Indian Sub-continent\\nThe packages and practices of different crops are given in the chapter 15.

For e.g., the following is the water requirement of some crops; Banana\\n2000-2200 mm; Rice 1100-1150 mm; Sorghum 400-450 mm; Cotton 550-650 mm.\\n(iii) Socio-economic aspects of the farmer - Big farmers and rich farmers can purchase inputs like\\nfertilizers, pesticides and apply in time, but poor small and marginal farmers cannot do so.\\nEducation status, knowledge about principles and practices of crop production, technological\\nknow-how and skill also plays a major role in crop selection and management.\\n(iv) Marketing facilities - Mostly marketing facilities are available near the town, cities and agro\\nbased processing industries. Farmers prefer a crop, the produce of which will fetch high price\\nin the market. In earlier days sunflower and soybean were grown in limited areas due to lack of\\nprocessing industry. Now, due to industrial development they are grown in large scale.\\n(v) Economics - The ultimate objective of commercial farming is to produce more produce per\\nrupee invested. Based on this criteria farmers select the high yielding varieties of maize, sor-\\nghum, sunflower and hybrid maize, hybrid cotton that produce more yield than local varieties.\\nGenerally farmers are interested to grow  the hybrids to get maximum monetary benefits i.e.,\\nmore income per rupee invested.\\n3.3 INTENSIVE CROPPING\\nDefinition: Intensive cropping is the process of gro wing a number of crops on the same piece of land\\nduring the given period of time.\\nMethod of intensive cropping - The following methods have been developed to make intensive\\ncropping a success.\\n3.3.1 Multiple Cropping\\nGrowing two or more crops on the same field in one year. The intensification of cropping is in temporal\\nand spatial dimensions. Double, triple and quadruple cropping refers to growing two, three and four\\ncrops respectively, on the same land in a year in sequence.\\n(a) Sequential cropping - Multiple cropping may be of the following types growing two or more\\ncrops in sequence (in succession) on the same field in an year. The succeeding crop is planted\\nafter the proceeding crop has been harvested. The crop intensification is only in time dimension.\\ne.g., Rice-Rice-Cotton, Ragi-Cotton-Sorghum.\\n(b) Relay cropping - It refers to planting of the succeeding crop before harvesting the preceding\\ncrop. e.g.,  ( i) Rice–Black gram (rice fallow pulse), (ii ) Rice–Lathyrus, ( iii) Rice–Lucerne,\\n(iv) Rice–Berseem and (v) Cotton–Berseem. Here the seeds of black gram, lathyrus, lucerne or\\nberseem are broadcasted in standing rice or cotton crop just before they are ready for harvesting.\\nThus the field is never left fallow or there is no gap at all between two successive crops.\\n(c) Ratoon cropping or ratooning - It refers to raising a crop with regrowth coming out of roots or\\nstalks after harvest of the crop although not necessarily for grain.  e.g., Sugarcane, Banana,\\nSorghum.\\n(d) Overlapping system of cropping -  In this system the crop is harvested in phases and the vacated\\narea is sown by next crop. e.g., forage crops, part of the crop is harvested for feeding to the cattle\\nand vacated area is sown with alternate crops like berseem or lucerne.\\n3.3.2 Intercropping\\nGrowing two or more crops simultaneously on the same field. The crop intensification is in both\\ntemporal and spatial dimensions. There is intercrop competition all or part of crop growth (as opposed\\nto intercropping, sole cropping is growing one crop alone in pure stand at normal density).'),\n",

Types of intercropping based on Interactions\\n1. Parallel cropping - Under this two crops are selected which have different growth habits and\\nhave a zero competition between each other and both of them express their full yield potential.\\ne.g., black gram with maize, soybean with cotton.\\n2. Companion cropping - Usually a short duration crop is gr own along with a long duration crop\\nas a companion crop i.e., the base crop gets the company of another crop for a certain period.\\ne.g., Cotton + black gram/Green gram.\\n3.

It is practiced in orchards and\\nplantation crops for maximum use of solar energy even under normal planting density. e.g., Sugarcane,\\npotato and onion, coconut,  pepper, cocoa and pineapple.\\n3.4 CROP ROTATION\\nCrop rotation may also be defined as a process of growing different crops in succession on a piece of\\nland in a specific period of time with an object to get maximum profit from minimum investment\\nwithout impairing the soil fertility.\\nA.  Principles and Advantages\\nIf the same crop is repeatedly gr own on the same land it is referred as monoculture or monocropping\\n(e.g., rice-rice-rice) whereas crop rotation is the repetitive cultivation of an orderly succession of\\ndifferent crops and crops and fallow on the same land. One cycle may take seve ral years (one year or\\nmore than one year) to complete e.g., rice-rice-pulse (one year), sugarcane–ratoon sugarcane–Rice (2\\nor 3 years), banana–ratoon banana–rice (3 years).\\nB.  Principles of Crop Rotation\\n\\x7f The crops with tap roots (deep rooted) should be followed by those, which have fibrous\\n(shallow) root system. This helps in proper and uni form use of nutrients from the soil.\\n\\x7f The leguminous crops should be grown bef ore non-leguminous crops because legumes fix\\natmospheric N into soil and add more organic matter to the soil.\\n\\x7f More exhaustive crops should be followed by less exhaustive crops because crops like potato,\\nsugarcane, maize etc., need more inputs such as be tter tillage, more fertilizers, greater number\\nof irrigations etc.\\n\\x7f Selection of the crop should be demand based.\\n\\x7f The crop of the same family should not be grown in succession because they act as alternate\\nhosts for insect pests and diseases.\\n\\x7f An ideal crop rotation is one, which provides maximum employment to the farm family and\\nlabour and permits efficient use of mac hines and equipments and ensures timely agricultural\\noperations simultaneously maintaining soil productivity.\\n\\x7f The selection of the crops should be problem based i.e.\\n\\x7f One sloppy lands, which are prone to erosion, an alternate cropping of erosion promoting\\nand erosion resisting crops lik e legumes should be adopted.\\n\\x7f In low-lying and flood prone ar ea, the crops, which can tolerate water stagnation, should be\\nselected.\\n\\x7f Under dry farming the cr ops, which can tolerate the drought, should be selected.'),\n",

Most of the\\ncrops receive their water supply from rainwater. Rainwater is the source of soil moisture so\\nessential for the life of a plant. The yearly precipitation, both in total amount and seasonal\\ndistribution greatly affects the choice of culti vated crops of a place. Low and ill-distributed\\nrainfall are common features of dry farming wherein drought resistant crops like sorghum, pearl\\nmillet, Italian millet and other minor millets are commonly grown. On the other hand in places\\nof heavy and regular rainfall areas such as in the Western Ghats of India crops like rice are grown\\nin flat areas while tea, coffee, rubber etc., are grown in the slopes. The interaction of rainfall with\\ntemperature has a very profound effect on the vegetation and soil of a place.

The range of temperature\\nfor maximum growth of most of the agricultural plans is between 15 and 40°C. The temperature\\nof a place is largely determined by its distance from the equator (latitude) and the altitude.

Daily cycle of temperature (Diurnal Variation)\\nFrom sun rice until 2-4 pm, when the energy is being supplied by incoming solar radiation is faster than\\nit is being lost by earth by re-radiation, the air temperature rises. From about 2-4 pm when the loss of\\nradiation by earth exceeds receipt of solar energy the temperature falls. It is noticeable that the time of\\nhighest temperature (2-4 pm) does not, however, exactly coincide with that of noon solar radiation. This\\nlag occurs because temperature continued to rise as long as the amount of incoming solar radiation\\nexceeds the outgoing earth’s radiation. Although the energy receipts being to decline in the afternoon\\nthey continue to exceed the energy losses until about 3 pm. The energy gained during the day is slowly\\nlost to the atmosphere by re-radiation, resulting in the reduction of temperature. Hence, minimum\\ntemperature is reached between 2 to 6 am. Diurnal = pertaining to action that are completed within 24\\nhours and that recur every 24 hours. This variation is knows as diurnal variation. The temperature\\ndistribution varies with latitude, altitude and the seasons. It varies diurnally at a given location because\\nof the rotation of the earth.\\nC.  Vertical distribution (altitude)\\nAs a general rule throughout the troposphere, the temperature decreases with elevation. The rate of\\ndecrease with altitude is not uniform; it varies with time of the day, season and location. The average\\ndecrease is approximately 0.65oC/100 m. (6.5o C/km). This is knows as normal lapse rate or vertical\\ntemperature gradient.'),\n",

The main factors contributing to\\nseasonal variations are:\\n\\x7f The angel of inclination of solar rays, which decides the intensity of radiation.\\n\\x7f Distance between earth and sun.\\n\\x7f The movement of seasonal winds which contr ibutes to rain and precipitation.\\nG.  Effect of temperature\\nAir temperature is the most important weather parameter, which affects the plant life. The growth of\\nhigher plants is restricted to a temperature between 0–60oC and the optimum 10oC–40oC. Beyond these\\nlimits, plants are damaged severely and even get killed. The maximum production of dry matter occurs\\nwhen the temperature ranges from 20 to 30oC. Apart from yield reductions, many visible injuries on the\\nplants are seen due to very low or very high temperature.\\nI.  Low temperature effects\\n(a) Cold injury - Plants are injured due to very low temperature in the following ways:\\nChilling injury - Plants growing in hot climate, if exposed to low temperature (which is above the\\nfreezing point) for some time, are found to be killed or injured severely.  e.g., Chlorotic condition or\\nbands on leaves of sugarcane, sorghum and maize when exposed for 60 hours at 2–4 oC.\\nFreezing injury - This is generally caused in plants growing in temperate region. When the plants\\nare exposed to very low temperature, water is frozen into ice crystals in the intercellular spaces. With\\nfurther fall in temperature, water is withdrawn from the cells, resulting in increase in the size of ice\\ncrystals in the intercellular spaces. The protoplasm of the cell is dehydrated, and mechanical distortion\\ntakes place resulting in killing of the cells. Frost damage to potatoes, tea etc., in winter in the hilly areas\\nlike the Nilgiris is a typical e.g., of the freezing injury.\\nSuffocation - During winter the ice or the snow form a thick cover over the ground and the crop\\nsuffers for want of oxygen. Ice in contact with roots inhibits diffusion of carbon dioxide and the\\nrespiratory products may become harmful to plants.'),\n",

High temperature effects\\nCells of most plant species get killed when the tem perature ranges from 50 to 60 oC. This point of\\ntemperature is called thermal death point. But it varies with the species, the age of tissue and the time\\nof exposure to high temperature. It is reported that most plant cells are killed at a temperature of 45 to\\n55oC. Some plants tissues withstand a temperature of up to 105oC. The aquatic plants and shade loving\\nplants are killed at comparatively, lower temperature (40oC); where as, for xerophytes it is 50 oC. High\\ntemperature results in desiccation of the plants and disturbs the balance between photosynthesis and\\nrespiration. Higher temperature increases the respiration leading to rapid depletion of reserve food in\\nplants resulting in growth stunted due to incipient or starvation.\\nHeat injury - Very high temperature often stops growth. The plant faces incipient starvation due\\nto high respiration rates. The plant is stunted and if such a condition persists for a long period the plant\\nis killed. Direct temperatur e effects are noticeable in young seedlings and transplanted crops. High\\ntemperature causes sterility in flowers. The general effects of excessive heat are defoliation, premature\\ndropping of fruits and in extreme cases death of plants.\\n(i) Sun clad: Injury caused by high temperature on the sides of bark is known as sun clad. This is\\nnothing but exposure of barks of the stems to high temperature during daytime and low tempera-\\nture during nighttime.\\n(ii) Stem girdle: It is another injury associated with high temperature. High temperature at the soil\\nsurface scorches the stems at ground level. T his type of injury is very common in young seed-\\nlings of cotton in sandy soil where the after noon soil temperature exceeds 60 oC to 65 oC. The\\nstem girdle injury is first noticed through a discoloured band a new millimeter wide. This is\\nfollowed by shrinkage of the tissues, which have been discoloured. The stem girdle causes the\\ndeath of the plant by destroying the conductive and cambial tissues or by the establishment of\\npathogens in the injury. As direct effects on crop plants high temperature causes sterility in\\nflowers. The general effects of excessive hea t are defoliation, pre-mature dropping of fruits. In\\nextreme cases, death of the plants may also occurs.\\nA.  Effects of Temperature on Crop Production\\nPlants can grow only within certain limits of temperatur e. For each species and variety there are not\\nonly optimal temperature limits, but also optimal temperatures for different growth stages and func-\\ntions, as well as lower and upper lethal limits. During photosynthesis there are certain biochemical\\nprocesses preceding and following the reduction of carbon dioxide, which are affected mainly by\\ntemperature. As long as light is limiting, temperature has little effect on the rate of photosynthesis.\\nWhen light is not limiting, it has a profound eff ect on the rate of photosynthesis. In general, high\\ntemperature accelerates growth process. Rarely are high temperatures per se  the direct cause of death\\nof plants, provided the water supply is adequate. Retardation of growth and difficulties in fertilization\\nare observed even in heat loving crops such as sorghum, at extremes of temperatures. The harmful\\neffects of excessive temperatures are usually aggravated by lack of available moisture. Hot dry winds\\nwill further increase the damage. Increasing temperatures increases evapotranspiration. The daily alter-\\nnations of high and low temperature may effect grain production.\\nB.

( e.g.) The coldest month is January in northern\\nregions of India while December in the south. Similarly, the warmest month is May in the south while\\nJune in the north across the country.\\nAltitude - The surface air temperature decreases with increasing altitude from the mean sea level\\nas the density of air decreases. Since the density of air is less at higher altitudes, the absorbing capacity\\nof air is relatively less with re ference to earth’s long wave radiation.\\nDistribution of land and water - Land and water surfaces react differently to the insolation.\\nBecause of the great contrasts between land and water surf aces their capacity for heating the atmos-\\nphere varies. V ariations in air temperature are much greater over the land than over the water. The\\ndifferential heating process between land and sea surfaces are due to their properties. It is one of the\\nreasons for Indian monsoon.\\nOcean currents - The energy received over the ocean surface carried away by the ocean currents\\nfrom the warm areas to cool areas. This results in temperature contrast between the equator and poles.\\nThe occurrence of El Nino is due to change in sea surface temperature between two oceanic regions\\nover the globe.\\nPrevailing winds - Winds can moderate the surface temperature of the continents and oceans. In\\nthe absence of winds, we feel warm in hot climates. At the same time, the weather is pleasant if wind\\nblows.\\nCloudiness - The amount of cloudiness affects the temperature of the earth’s surface and the\\natmosphere. A thick cloud reduces the amount of insola tion received at a particular place and thus the\\ndaytime temperature is low. At the same time, the lower layers in the atmosphere absorb earth’s radia-\\ntion. This results in increasing atmospher ic temperature during night. That  is why, cloudy nights are\\nwarmer. This is common in the humid tropical climates.\\nMountain barriers - Air at the top of the mountain makes little contact with the ground and is\\ntherefore cold while in the valley at the foothills makes a great deal of contact and is therefore warm.\\nThat is, the lower region of the earth’s atmosphere is relatively warmer when compared to hillocks.\\nIII. Atmospheric humidity\\nWater is always present in the atmosphere in the form of invisible water vapour, normally known as\\nhumidity of the air. When the atmosphere contains the maximum possible amount of water vapour it is\\nsaid to be saturated at the particular temperature and pressure. Any increase in temperature, water\\nremaining constant, will make the air unsaturated. In unsaturated condition, the water vapour content\\nof air is usually expressed as relative humidity, which is the ratio between the actual humidity present\\nand the saturation humidity possible at that temperature. The r elative humidity of a place, is being\\naffected by temperature and pressure. It is also affected by wind, exposure to radiation, vegetation and\\nwater content of the soil. The evaporation of water from plants or a body of water is directly dependent\\non the relative humidity of the atmosphere.\\nHumidity: The terminology related to humidity and concer ned with gaseous form of water i.e.,\\nwater vapour, several expression of the amount of water vapour in the air is used.\\nAbsolute humidity: It denotes the actual mass of water vapour in given volume of air. It may be\\nexpressed as the number of grams of water vapour in a cubic meter of moist air or mass of water vapour\\nper unit volume of air.\\nSpecific humidity: It is defined as the moisture content of moist air as determined by the ratio of\\nthe mass of water vapour to the mass of moist air in which the mass of water vapour is contained.\\nRelative humidity: Relative humidity is a common parameter for expressing water vapour content'),\n",

Solar radiation\\nThe sun is the primary source of heat to the earth and its atmosphere. The heat received forms other\\ncelestial bodies as well as the interior of the earth is rather too insignificant to merit our attention. The\\ndistance that separates the earth from the sun is about 1,49,000,000 km. The diameter of the sun\\nmeasures roughly about 13,82,400 km. The surface temperature of the sun is estimated between 5500oC\\nand 6100oC (or 5762oK). Solar radiation provides more than 99.9% of the energy that heats the earth.\\nUndoubtedly, the radiant energy from the sun is the most important control of our weather and climate.\\nThe most astonishing fact about the incoming solar radiation (insolation) that strikes the earth’s surface\\nis that it is equal to about 23 billion horsepower. Actually it is this amount of energy received from the\\nsun that acts as the driving force for all the atmospheric as well as biolo gical processes on the earth.\\nBesides, all other sources of energy found on earth such as coal, oil and wood etc., are nothing but\\nconverted form of solar energy. The word ‘insolation’ is contraction of “incoming solar radiation”.\\nRadiant energy from the sun that strikes the earth is called insolation.\\nFig. 3.1\\nSolar energy provides two essential needs of plants ( a) light, required for photosynthesis and for\\nmany other functions of the plant-including seed germination, leaf expansion, growth of stem and\\nshoot, flowering, fruiting and even dormancy, and ( b) thermal conditions required for the normal\\nphysiological functions of the plant.\\nSolar radiation consists of a bundle of rays of radiant energy of different wavelengths. The sum\\nemits radiant energy in the form of electroma gnetic waves. The visible portion of the solar spectrum\\nappears as light. Light travels with a speed of 2,97,600 km/sec. It takes 8 minutes and 20 seconds to\\nreach the earth. Light is the total effect of the combina tion of the seven different colours, namely red,\\norange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. (VIBGYOR). The waves that produce the effect of red\\ncolour are the longest and those producing the violet are the shortest. Waves shorter than the violet are\\ncalled ultraviolet rays, while those longer than the red are known as infrared rays. The ultra violet waves\\nform only 6% of the insolation, but have strong photochemical effects on some substances. The infrared\\nrays, even though invisible, form 43% of the insolation. They are largely absorbed by water vapour that\\nis concentrated in the lower atmosphere.\\nSpring equinox 21 March\\nSpring Winter\\nSun’s rays\\nEquator\\n146.2 m km\\nPerihelion 3rd January\\nWinter slostice\\n21 DecemberAutumn\\nSun\\nAphelion 4th July\\nSummer soistice\\n21 June\\n154 m km\\nAutumn equinox 23 September\\nSummer\\nSun’s rays\\nArctic circle'),\n",

Since there is fluctuation in the amount of radiant energy emitted\\nby the sun due to periodic disturbances on the solar surface, the amount of solar constant, therefore,\\nregisters a slight increase or decrease. However, this variation hardly exceeds 2-3%.\\nLight is one of the most important clima tic factors for many vital processes of the plant. It is\\nindispensable for the synthesis of the most important pigment of the plant, i.e., the green chlorophyll.\\nThe chlorophyll is capable of absorbing radiant energy and converting it into potential chemical energy\\nof carbohydrates. The carbohydr ates manufactured by the plants during photosynthesis are the only\\nlink between the solar energy and the living world.  It regulates the rate of transpiration by controlling\\nthe opening and closing of stomata. Light affects the plants through its intensity, quality (wave length),\\nduration (photoperiod) and direction.\\n1. Light intensity - The variations in light intensity are always accompanied with change in tem-\\nperature and relative humidity and therefore it is difficult to evaluate light effects alone.\\nGenerally speaking light intensity falling at a particular place is normally enough for the plants\\nand their physiological phenomena viz., photosynthesis.\\nIn photosynthesis about one percent of the light energy is converted into potential chemical\\nenergy. V ery low light intensity reduces the rate of photosynthesis and may even result in the\\nclosing of the stomata. This results in reduced vegetative growth of the plants. Very high light\\nintensities are detrimental to plants in many ways. It increases the rate of respiration and thus\\ndisturbs the photosynthesis–respiration balance. It causes rapid loss of water resulting in the\\nclosure of stomata. The most harmful effect of high light intensity is the phenomenon of\\n“Solarization” in which all the cell contents are oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. This oxidation\\nis different from r espiration and is termed as photo oxidation.\\nBased on the response to light intensities, the plants are classified as follows:\\n(i) Sciophytes (Shade loving plants) - The plants that grow better under partially shaded (low\\nlight) conditions e.g., betel vines, buckwheat, turmeric etc.\\n(ii) Heliophytes ( Sun loving plants) -  Many species of plants produce maximum dry matter\\nunder high light intensities when the moisture is available at the optimum level, e.g., maize,\\nsorghum, rice etc. Except under glass house or shaded conditions, intensity of light cannot\\nbe controlled.\\nDepending upon the nature of the crops, the dry matter production is affected. Many species\\nproduce maximum dry matter under high light intensity if water is available in plenty.\\nHowever crops like betelvine, turmeric, buckwheat, and tobacco grown during summer\\nproduce greater dry matter if slightly shaded.\\n2. Quality of light - When white light is passed through a prism  it is dispersed into wavelengths\\nof different colors; violet 400-435 mill micr ons (mµ); blue 435–490; green 490–574; yellow\\n574–595; orange 595–626 and red 626 to 750 mµ.

Among these short rays beyond the violet such as Ultra Violet rays, X rays and Gamma\\nrays and longer rays beyond red such as infrared are detrimental to growth. Red light seems to\\nbe the most favourable light for growth followed by violet-blue. Ultraviolet and shorter wave-\\nlengths of the visible light are scattered and infrar ed and longer wavelengths are absorbed by\\nmoisture of the atmosphere. Such a light is called diffused light or skylight. Ultraviolet and\\nshorter wavelengths kill bacteria and many fungi.\\n3. Duration of light - It is important from the farmer’s point of view in selecting the variety of a\\ncrop. The length of the day has greater influence than the intensity. The response of plants to the\\nrelative length of day and night is known as ‘ photo periodism ’. Plants which develop and\\nproduce normally when the photoperiod is greater than a critical minimum (more than 12 hours\\nof illumination) are called ‘long day plants’ (sugar beet, wheat, barley) and those develop nor-\\nmally when the photoperiod is less than a critical maximum (less than 12 hours of illumination)\\nare called ‘short day plants’ (soybeans, maize and millets). Some plants are found to be\\nunaffected by photoperiod and are called as ‘ day-neutral’ plants (Tomato, asparagus etc.)\\nPlant characters like floral development, floral initiation, bulb formation, rhizome production\\netc. are all influenced by photo-periodism. If a long day plant is subjected to short day periods\\nthe internodes may be shortened to give a rosette appearance and flowering will not take place.\\nIn the same way when a short day plant is subjected to long day period, the growth of the plant\\nbecomes abnormal and there is no floral initiation (For e.g., CO 36 rice variety).\\n4. Direction of light - Shoots, roots and leaves show different orientation to the direction of light.\\nIn temperate regions, the southern slopes show better growth of crops than the northern slopes\\ndue to the direction of light contributing more  sunlight towards the southern side.\\n(i) Orientation of leaves - The change of position or orientation of organs of plants caused by\\nlight is usually called as “Phototropism”. For e.g., the leaves are oriented at right angles to\\nincidence of light to receive  maximum radiation.\\n(ii) Photomorphogenesis - Change in the morphology of plants due to light. This is mainly due\\nto ultra violet and violet rays of the sun.\\nInstruments used for measuring solar radiation - Bellanis pyranometer, Sunshine recorder, Line\\nquantum sensor, Photometer, Lux meter measures the light intensity and Radiometer.\\nV. Wind velocity and its effect on crop production\\nAir in horizontal motion is known as wind. V ertical movement is noticed but negligibly small compared\\nto horizontal movement as the height of the atmosphere is only for few km. However vertical movement\\nor uplift of air only causes significant weather changes in cloud formation and rain. The velocity of\\nwind at a place depends on various factors such as geographical situation, topography, altitude, distance\\nfrom seashore, flat plains, vegetation etc. Wind affects crop growth mechanically (directly) and\\nphysiologically (indirect).\\nWind speed in different seasons\\nWinds represent air in motion. The primary cause of all winds is regional differences in temperature,\\nproducing regional differences in pressure. When these pressure differences persist for several hours,\\nthe rotation of the earth m odifies the direction of motion, till the winds blow along lines of equal'),\n",

Wind direction and speed are modified frequently due to seasonal variation in solar radiation\\nand differential heating of the earth’s surface.\\n1. Wind speed: The winds are generally measured over level, open terrain at 3 metres about\\nground. Yet, a general idea of the distribution of the mean daily wind speed, on an annual basis\\nas well as on a monthly basis, would be useful. The mean daily wind speed is the value obtained\\nby averaging the wind speed (irrespective of direction) for a whole day. This averaged for all the\\ndays of a month is the mean daily wind speed for tha t month. The daily values averaged for all\\nthe 365 days of the year is the annual mean daily wind speed.\\n2. Wind Direction: Winds are always named after the direction they come from. Thus, a wind\\nfrom the south, blowing towards north is called south wind. The wind vane is an instrument used\\nto find out the direction of the wind. W indward refers to the direction wind comes from, and\\nleeward refers to the direction it blows to. When a wind blows more frequently from one direc-\\ntion than from any other, it is called a prevailing wind.\\n3. South West Monsoon wind direction:  During South West Monsoon period of June to\\nSeptember, the westerly winds prevail on the west of Kerala and south winds on the west of\\nnorthern Circars, Orissa and Beng al. During April and May the regi on of high temperature is\\nshifted to north  viz., upper Sind, lower Punjab and Western Rajasthan. This area becomes the\\nminimum barometric pressure area to which monsoon winds are directed.\\n4. North East Monsoon wind direction:  During North East Monsoon period of October to\\nDecember, on account of the increase in barometric pressure in Northern India, there is a shift\\nin the barometric pressure to the South East and North Easterly winds begin to flow on the\\neastern coast, by the end of September.

It is the main raw material for the manufacture of carbohydrates by the\\nphotosynthetic process of the green plants. Photosynthesis is approximately proportional to the\\nconcentration of CO 2 in the air surrounding the foliage of the crop. The CO 2, which gets\\nincorporated into the organic compounds of the plants, returns to the atmospher e by respiratory\\nbreak down of these compounds and by the death, decay and combustion of plants (carbon\\ncycle). Increased growth and greater yield of vegetables are possible under green house conditions\\nby increasing the content. Aquatic plants utilize the dissolved CO 2, from water.\\n(b) Oxygen - Life sustains because of oxygen. The amount of O 2, is normally constant in the air\\nbecause plants give off O 2, during photosynthesis.\\n(c) Nitrogen - Lightning, rainfall and nitrogen fixing microorganism contributes nitrogen to the soil\\nfrom the atmosphere. Symbiotic bacter ia like rhizobium, free-living bacteria like azotobacter,\\nblue green algae etc., fix a good amount of nitrogen in the soil. The decomposition of dead\\nplants and animals also adds N to the soil. The N in the soil is made available to the crops by\\nthe activity of nitrifying bacteria. Certain gases like SO2, CO and HF when released into the air\\nin sufficient quantities are toxic to plants.\\nA. Edaphic factors\\nPlants grown in a land are completely dependent on the soil in which they grow for anchorage, water\\nand mineral nutrients. The soil factors, which affect the crop growth, are:\\n1. Soil moisture; 2. Soil air; 3. Soil temperature; 4. Soil mineral matter; 5. Soil organic matter,\\n6. Soil organisms, and 7.

O 2 is\\nrequired for respiration of r oots and microorganisms. In poorly aerated soil the CO 2 get accumulated\\nand is detrimental, for absorption of water by the roots. Soil air is also useful in increasing the nutrient\\navailability of the soil by,\\n\\x7f breaking down the insoluble mineral into soluble salts;\\n\\x7f decomposing organic matter, and\\n\\x7f bringing out nitrifying (nitrogen releasing) and nitrogen fixing processes of bacteria.\\nSoil temperature - It affects the physical and chemical processes going on in the soil. It influences\\nthe rate of absorption of water and solutes, the germination of seeds and the rate of growth of the\\nunderground portions of the plant body.\\nThe maximum absorption of water by the roots takes place generally between 20°C and 30°C.\\nTemperature below 20°C causes appreciable reduction in the rate of absorption of water. Cold soils are\\ntherefore not conducive for rapid growth of most agricultural crops. Soil temperature controls micro-\\nbiological activity and processes involved in the availability of nutrients to plants. Nitrification begins\\nin the soil when the temperature reaches about 5°C.\\nSoil mineral matter - The mineral content of the soil is derived from the weathering of the rooks\\nand minerals as particles of different sizes. These are sources of plant nutrients such as Si, Ca, Mg, Fe,\\nK, Na and Al. Minor elements (trace elements) like B, Mo, Zn, Cu, Co, Iodine and Fe are also present\\nin very small quantities.\\nSoil organic matter - The soil organic matter content varies from less than 1% in arid sandy soils\\nto as much as 90% of dry weight of well developed soil. It has a marked influence on the soil properties\\nand growth of crops. The organic matter of the soil is derived from (i) dead and decaying roots of plants\\nand living organisms present in the soil, and (ii) dry leaves, twigs, dead plants and animals added to the\\nsoils.\\nAdvantages of soil organic matter\\n\\x7f It is the source of essential plant nutrients for crop growth.

Biotic factors\\nBeneficial or harmful effects caused by other plants and animals on the crop plants are the effect of\\nbiotic factors.\\nPlants\\n(a) Competitive and complimentary nature among field crops - Competition between plants occurs\\nwhen there is demand for nutri ents, moisture and sunlight, particular ly when they are in short\\nsupply or the plants are closely spaced. Optimum spacing of crops is an important agronomical\\npractice. When different crops such as cereals and legumes are grown together as in mixed\\ncropping there is mutual benefit resulting in better yield.\\n(b) Competition between weed and crop - Weeds reduce crop yields due to competition with crops\\nfor water, soil nutrients and light. In dry farming condition weeds compete with crops for water.\\nIn irrigated tracts, the competition is severe for nutrients. Weeds in fallow land deplete the soil\\nof both moisture and nutrients.\\n(c) Plants as Parasites - A plant parasite is dependent on its host plant for its existence.

Altitude of the place:  Increase in altitude causes decrease in temperature and increase in\\nprecipitation and wind velocity.\\n2. Steepness of slope: It causes swift run off of rainwater resulting decreased moisture content\\nof soil. The organic matter of the soil increases resulting in high N content and acidity of the\\nsoil.\\n3. Exposure of the slope to light and wind: A mountain slope exposed to weak intensity of light\\nand strong dry winds as the case of northern slopes of temperate regions and the Himalayas\\nmay have poor crops due to want of moisture and sunlight.

It is a branch of physics dealing with atmosphere and it is often\\nquoted as the “Physics of the lower atmosphere”. It studies the individual phenomenon of the atmos-\\nphere. In other words, it is concerned with the study of the characteristics and behaviour of the atmos-\\npheres. It explains and analyses the changes of individual weather elements such as air pressure,\\ntemperature and humidity that are brought about due to the effect of insolation (radiation from the sun\\nreceived by earth’s surface).\\nAgricultural meteorology is a branch of applied meteor ology, which investigates the physical condi-\\ntions of the environment of growing plants or animal organisms.

Agrometeorology\\ndeals with the behaviour of the weather elements, whic h have direct relevance to agriculture and their\\neffect on crop production. Weather and climate are the important factors determining the success or\\nfailure of agriculture. Weather influences agricultural operations from sowing of a crop to the harvest\\nand particularly rainfed agriculture depends on the mer cy of the weather. In India every year there is\\na considerable damage by floods in one part of the country and a severe drought causing famines in\\nanother part. The total annual pre harvest losses for the various crops are estimated from 10 to 100%;\\nwhile, the post harvest losses are estimated between 5 and 15%.

In brief, climatology may be defined as the scientific study of climate. In the early\\ncivilization, Gods were often assigned to the climatic elements, Indians still hold\\nceremonial worships/dances to God’s to produce rains at times of drought. The Greek philosophers\\nshowed a great interest in meteorological science. It concerns with the integration of day-to-day weather\\nover a period of time. It is very essential to dif ferentiate the terms climate and weather.\\nA.  Weather and Climate\\nIn Climatology, the terms “Weather” and “Climate” have different connotations. Weather refers to the state\\nof atmosphere at any give time denoting the short-term variations of atmosphere in terms of temperature,\\npressure, wind, moisture cloudiness, precipitation and visibility. It is highly variable, constantly changing,\\nsometimes from hour to hour and at other times from day to day. The afore-mentioned properties of the\\natmosphere are subject to constant change and their state at any time determines the state of the weather.\\nHowever, weather elements are not separate rather they are closely related with each other.\\nClimate on the other hand, is the sum or total of the variety of weather conditions of place or an\\narea. It may be defined as the sum of all statistical we ather information of a particular area during a\\nspecified interval of time, usually several decades. The WMO has suggested standard period of 31 years\\nfor calculating the climatic averages of different weather elements.\\nB.  Factors affecting Weather and Climate\\nLatitude -  Based on latitude, the climate has been classified as: ( i) Tropical, ( ii) Subtropical,\\n(iii) Temperate and (iv) Polar. The tropical climate is characterized by high temperature throughout the\\nyear. Subtropical is also characterized by high tempera ture alternating with low temperature in winter.\\nThe temperate climate has low temperature throughout the year. The polar climate is noted for its very\\nlow temperature throughout the year.\\nAltitude (Elevation) - The height from the mean sea level creates variation in climate. Even in the\\ntropical regions, the high mountains have temperate climate. The temperature decreases by 1.8 oC for\\nevery 300 m from the sea level. Generally, there is a decrease in pressure and increase in precipitation\\nand wind velocity. The above factors alter the kind of vegetation, soil types and the crop production.\\nPrecipitation - The quantity and distribution of rainfall decides the nature of vegetation and the\\nnature of the cultivated crops. The crop region are classified on the basis of average rainfall which are\\nas follows:\\nRainfall (mm) Climatic region\\nLess than 500 Arid\\n500 - 750 Semi Arid\\n750 - 1000 Sub humid\\nMore than 1000 Humid\\nSoil Type: Soil is a product of climatic action on rocks as modified by landscape and vegetation\\nover a long period of time. The colour of the soil surface affects the absorption, storage and re-radiation\\nof heat. White colour reflects while the b lack absorbs more radiation. Due to differential absorption of\\nheat energy, variations in temperature are created at different places. In black soil areas, the climate is\\nhot; while in red soil areas, it is compar atively cooler due to lesser heat absorption.'),\n",

Some of the gases (N, O 2, Ar, CO2) may be regarded as permanent atmospheric com-\\nponents that remain in fixed proportions to the total gas volume. Other constituents vary in quantity\\nfrom place to place and from time to time. If the suspended particles, water vapour and other variable\\ngases are excluded from the atmosphere, the dry air is very stable all over the earth up to an altitude of\\nabout 80 km. The principal gases comprising dry air in the lower atmosphere is given as follows:\\nConstituents    % by volume\\nNitrogen (N2) 78.08\\nOxygen (O2) 20.94\\n* Argon (Ar) 0.93\\nCarbon dioxide (CO 2) 0.03\\n* Neon (Ne) 0.0018\\n* Helium (He) 0.0005\\nOzone (O3) 0.00006\\nHydrogen (H2) 0.00005\\n* Krypton (Kr) Trace\\n* Xenon (Xe) Trace\\nMethane (Me) Trace\\n*Inert chemically never found in any chemical compounds.\\n(a) Gases - N and O2 make up about 99% of the clean, dry air. The remaining gases are mostly inert\\nand constitute about 1% of the atmosphere generally homogeneous and it is called as homosphere. At\\nhigher altitudes, the chemical constituent of air is changed considerably. The layer is known as the\\nheterosphere.\\nN2 - Relatively inactive chemically. It regulates combustion by diluting O 2 and indirectly helps\\noxidation. Mainly diluent.\\nCO2 - Plants take CO 2 in the process of photosynthesis. It is an efficient absorber of heat from\\nupper atmosphere as well as the earth. It emits half of the absorbed heat back to earth. It influences flow\\nof energy through the atmosphere. The probation remains same but percentage increases due to burning\\nof fossil fuels. From 1890 to 1970, CO2 content has been increased more than 10 times, result in\\nwarming of lower atmosphere and climatic changes.\\nOzone (O3) - It is a type of oxygen molecule formed of three atoms rather than two. It is found only\\nin very small quantity in the upper atmosphere. It is less than 0.0006% by volume. The maximum\\nconcentration of ozone is found between about 30 and 60 km. Although it is formed at higher levels and\\ntransported downward. It is the most efficient absorber of the burning UV radiation from the sun and\\nacts as a filter. Absence of ozone layer will make the earth’s surface unfit for human habitation - for all\\nliving organisms. Of all the gases, oxygen happens to be the most important for it is essential to all\\nliving organisms.\\n(b) Water Vapour - Water vapour is one of the most variable gases in the atmosphere, which is\\npresent in small amounts, but is very important. The water vapour content of air may vary from\\n0.02% by volume in a cold dry climate to near ly 4% in the humid tropics. The variations in this\\npercentage over time and place are very important considerations climatically. Like CO2, water vapour\\nhas insulating action of the atmosphere.

Structure\\nThe earth’s atmosphere consists of zones or layers arranged like spherical shells based on altitude above\\nthe earth’s surface.

It has been\\nderived from the Greek word ‘tropos’ meaning “mixing” or turbulence. The average height of this\\nlowermost layer of the atmosphere is placed at about 14 km above sea level. Under normal conditions,\\nthe height of the troposphere at the poles is about 8 km,  while at the equator, it is about 16 km. A\\nshallow layer separating troposphere from the next thermal layer of the atmosphere (stratosphere) is\\nTropopause. It is marked by turbulence and eddies. It is also called connective region. Various types of\\nclouds, thunderstorms as well as cyclones and anticyclones occur in this sphere because of the\\nconcentration of almost all the water vapour (4% of the atmosphere composition) aerosols in it. Wind\\nvelocities increase with height and attain maximum at the top. Most important is decrease in temperature\\nwith increasing elevation up to 14 km.\\nStratosphere - The stratosphere begins at the troposphere, which forms its lower boundary.

Because of the concentra tion of ozone in this layer, it is called the\\nozonosphere. It is a warm layer because of selective a bsorption of ultra violet radiation by ozone. In\\nfact, it acts as a filter for ultra violet radiation from the sun. In this layer, the temperature increases with\\nheight @ 5 oC/km. The maximum temperature recorded in the ozonosphere is higher than that at the\\nearth’s surface. Because of the preponderance of chemical processes, this sphere is sometimes called as\\nchemosphere.\\nIonosphere - Ionosphere lies beyond the ozonosphere at a height of about 60 km above the earth’s\\nsurface. At this level, the ionization of atmosphere begins to occur. Above ozonosphere, the temperature\\nfalls again reaching a minimum of about 100oC at a height of 80 km above earth’s surface.

Classification of Clouds\\nClouds are usually classified according to their height and appearance.

There is some seasonal as well as latitudinal variation and there is\\nsome overlapping form time to time. However, the appearance of clouds is quite distinctive for each\\nheight category.\\nWMO cloud classification (1957) - The WMO classified the clouds according to their height and\\nappearance into 10 categories. From the height, clouds are grouped into 4 categories (viz., family A, B,\\nC and D) as stated below and there are sub categories in each of these main categories.\\nA.

The mean lower level is 7 km and the mean\\nupper level is 12 km in tropics and sub-tropics. In this f amily, there are three sub-categories:\\n1. Cirrus (Ci) - In these clouds ice crystals are present. It looks like wispy and feathery, and it is\\ndelicate, desist, white fibrous, and silky appearance. Sunrays pass through these clouds and\\nsunshine without shadow. It does not produce precipitation.\\n2. Cirrocumulus (Cc) - Like cirrus clouds, ice crystals are present in these clouds also. It looks\\nlike rippled sand or waves of the seashore.  It contains white globular masses and transparent\\nwith no shading effect. The sky is mackerel sky.\\n3. Cirrostratus (Cs) - Like the above two clouds, ice cr ystals are present in these clouds also. It\\nlooks like whitish veil and covers the entire sky with milky white appearance. It produces\\n“Halo”.\\nFamily B - The clouds in this category are middle clouds. The mean lower level is 2.5 km and the\\nmean upper level is 7 km in tropics and sub-tropics.

The height of these clouds extends from\\nground to upper level of 2.5 km in tropics and sub-tropics. In this family, there are 3 sub-categorizes.\\n1.

The mean low\\nlevel is 0.5 km and means upper level goes up to 16 km. In this family, there are two sub-categories.\\n1.

These clouds have thunderhead with towering anvil top and develop vertically.\\nThese clouds produce violent winds, thunderstorms, hails and lightening, during summer.\\nB.  Cloud Formation\\nAir contains moisture and this is extremely important to the formation of clouds. Cloud is formed\\naround microscopic particles such as dust, smoke, salt crystals and other materials that are present in\\nthe atmosphere. These materials are called “Cloud Condensation Nucleus” (CCN). Without these, no\\ncloud formation will take place. Certain special types known as “ice nucleus” on which cloud droplets\\nfreeze or ice crystals form directly for water vapour. Generally, condensation nuclei are present in\\nplenty in air. But there is scarcity for special ice forming nuclei. Generall y, clouds are made up of\\nbillions of these tiny water droplets or ice crystals or combination of both. There are two rain forming\\nprocess, viz., 1. Warm rain process (rain fall pr ocess in the tropics), and 2. Cold rain process.\\nWarm rain - Rain occurs when the temp is above 0°C never colder than 0°C and when larger\\ndroplets collide and absorb smaller cloud droplets. They grow larger and larger and become raindrops.\\nThis process is known as “Coalescence cold rain process”.\\nCold rain - It occurs when the cloud temperature is colder than 0°C. Clouds are usually with ice\\ncrystals and liquid water droplets. These crystals grow rapidly drawing moisture from the surrounding\\ncloud droplets until their weight-causes them to fall. Falling ice crystals may melt and join with smaller\\nliquid cloud droplets. Resulting in raindrops if ice crystals do not melt, they may grow into large\\nsnowflakes and reach the ground as snow.\\nC.

Principles of Rainmaking\\nClouds are classified into warm and cold clouds based on cloud top temperature. If the cloud tempera-\\nture is positive, these clouds are called warm clouds and if it is negative, they are called as cold clouds.\\nThe nucleus needed for precipitation differs with type of clouds. Hygroscopic materials are necessary\\nas nucleus for warm clouds.\\nCloud seeding - It is the process by which the conditions of the cloud, (dimension, life time and\\nsize) are modified by supplying them with suitable nucleus at proper time and place. For accelerating\\nthe warm rain process, seeding with very large nu clei such as salt crystals can be used. In the case of\\ncold rain process, seeding with ice nuclei such as silver iodide are used.\\nCloud seeding is one of the tools to mitigate the effects of drought. It is defined as a process in\\nwhich the precipitation is encouraged by injecting ar tificial condensation nuclei through aircrafts or\\nsuitable mechanism to induce rain from rain bearing cloud. The raindrops are several times heavier than\\ncloud droplets. These mechanisms are different for cold and warm clouds.\\n(a) Seeding of cold clouds\\nThis can be achieved by two ways as given below:\\n1. Dry ice seeding - Dry ice (solid carbon-dioxide) has certain specific features. It remains as it is\\nat –80°C and evaporates, but does not melt. Dry ice is heavy and falls rapidly from top of cloud\\nand has no persistent effects due to cloud seeding. Aircrafts are commonly used for cloud\\nseeding with dry ice. Aircraft flies across the top of a cloud and 0.5-1.0 cm dry ice pellets are\\nreleased in a steady stream. While falling through the cloud, a sheet of ice crystals is formed.\\nFrom these ice crystals, rain occurs. This method is not economical as 250 kg of dry ice is\\nrequired for seeding one cloud. To carry the heavy dry ice over the top of clouds special aircrafts\\nare required, which is an expensive process.\\n2. Silver Iodide seeding - Minute crystals of silver iodide produced in the form of smoke acts as\\nefficient ice-farming nuclei at temperatures below –5°C. When these nuclei are produced from\\nthe ground generators, these particles are fine enough to diffuse with air currents. Silver iodide\\nis the most effective nucleating substance because; its atomic arrangement is similar to that of\\nice. The time for silver iodide smoke released from ground generator to reach the super cooled\\nclouds was offer some hours, during which it would draft a long way and decay under the sun\\nlight. The appropriate procedure for seeding cold clouds would be to release silver iodide smoke\\ninto super cooled cloud from an aircraft. In seeding cold clouds, silver iodide technique is more\\nuseful than dry ice techniques, because, less quantity of silver iodide is required per cloud. There\\nis no necessity to fly to the top of the cloud, if area to be covered is large.\\n(b) Seeding of warm clouds\\n1. Water drop technique - Coalescence process is mainly responsible for growth of rain drops in\\nwarm cloud. The basic assumption is that the presence of comparatively large water droplets is\\nnecessary to initiate the coalescence process. So, water droplets or large hygroscopic nuclei are'),\n",

Water dr ops of 25 mm are sprayed fr om aircraft at 30 gallons per\\nseeding on warm clouds.\\n2. Common salt technique - Common salt is a suitable seeding material for seeding warm clouds.\\nIt is used either in the form of 10% solution or solid. The spraying is done by power sprayers and\\nair compressors or even from ground generators. The balloon burst technique is also beneficial.\\nIn this case, gunpowder and sodium chloride are arranged to explode near cloud base dispersing\\nsalt particles.\\n4.8 MONSOON RAINFALL VARIABILITY\\nIndia receives its annual rainfall by  the peculiar phenomenon known as monsoon. It consists of series\\nof cyclones that arise in Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal. These travel in north-east direction and enter\\nthe Peninsular India along its west coast. The most important of these cyclones usually occur from June\\nto September resulting in summer monsoon or south-west monsoon. This is followed by a second rainy\\nseason from October to December. A third and fourth rainy seasons occur from January to February and\\nfrom March to May respectively. Of the four rainy seasons, south-west monsoon is the most important\\nas it contribute 80–95% of the total rainfall of the country.\\n(a) South West Monsoon (SWM)  - In the beginning of the year, temperature of the Indian\\nPeninsular rapidly rises under the increasing heat of the sun. A minimum barometric pressure is\\nestablished in the interior parts of the Peninsular by the month of March. Westerly winds prevail\\non the west Kerala and south winds on the west of Orissa and Bengal. During April and May,\\nthe region of high temperature is shifted to north viz., upper Sind, lower Punjab and western\\nRajasthan. This area becomes the minimum barometric pressure area to which monsoon winds\\nare directed. The western branch of SWM touches north Karnataka, southern Maharashtra and\\nthen it make its way to Gujarat. When the South West Monsoon is fully operating on the Western\\nIndia, another branch of the same is acting in the Bay of Bengal. It carries rains to Burma,\\nNorthern portions of the east coast of India, Beng al, Assam and the whole of North India in\\ngeneral.\\n(b) North East Monsoon (NEM)  - During September end, the SWM penetrates to north western\\nIndia but stays on for a full month in Bengal. On account of the increase in barometric pressure\\nin Northern India, there is a shift of the barometric pressure to the South East and North Easterly\\nwinds begin to flow on the eastern coast. These changes bring on heavy and continuous rainfall\\nto the southern and south eastern India.\\n(c) Winter rainfall - It is restricted more to northern India and is received in the form of snow on\\nthe hills and as rains in the plains of Punjab, Rajasthan and central India.

It is\\nmostly received in the South-east of Peninsular and in Bengal. Western India does not generally\\nreceive these rains.\\n4.9 EVAPORATION, TRANSPIRATION AND ET\\nA.  Evaporation\\nThe change of state of water from solid and liquid to the vapour and its diffusion into the atmosphere\\nis referred to as evaporation. In agricultural meteorology, evaporation is defined as the maximum\\npossible loss of moisture form a wet, horizontal, flat surface exposed to weather parameters, which\\nexist in the vicinity of plants. Evaporation is an important process of hydrologic cycle. The evaporation\\nfrom the soil is an important factor deciding the irrigation water requirements of a crop. In modifying\\nthe microclimate of a crop, the evaporation from the soils is an important factor. It is the most important\\nof all the factors in the heat budget, after radiation and in the water economy. Since, a certain amount\\nof evaporation also demands a definite amount of heat, it provides a link between water budget and heat\\nbudget.\\nFactors affecting evaporation - The evaporation from a fully exposed water surface is the function\\nof several environmental factors.\\n1.  Environmental factors\\nWater temperature - With an increase of temperature, the kinetic energy of water molecules increases\\nand surface tension decreases which increases evaporation.\\nWind - The evaporation from fully exposed surface is directly proportional to the velocity of wind\\nand vice-versa, because dry wind replaces the moist air near water. The process of evaporation takes\\nplace continuously when there is a supply of energy to provide latent heat of evaporation (540 calories/\\ngram of water).\\nRelative humidity - The evaporation is greater at low RH than at high RH.\\nPressure - The evaporation is more at low pressure and less at high pressure.\\n2.  Water factors\\nComposition of water - The dissolved salts and other impurities decrease the rate of evaporation. The\\nevaporation is inversely proportional to the salinity of water.\\nArea of evaporation  - The larger the area of exposure, greater will be the evaporation. Those\\naffecting water supply at the evaporating surface. i.e., soil and plants including soil storage capacity,\\nrainfall and irrigation and those affecting energy supply to the evaporating surface like solar radiation.\\nB.  Transpiration\\nMost of the water absorbed by plants is lost to the atmosphere. This loss of water from living plants is\\ncalled transpiration. It can be stomatal, cuticular or lenticular. It plays an important role in dissipation\\nof radiant energy by plant parts, translocation of water in the plants and translocation of minerals in the\\nplant.\\nFactors affecting transpiration\\n(i) Environmental factors\\nLight: By directly opening and closing of the stomata, there is periodicity in the transpiration rate.\\nIndirectly by increasing the temperature of leaf cells, the transpiration is increased.'),\n",

Evapotranspiration (ET)\\nEvapotranspiration denotes the quantity of water transpired by plants or retained in the plant tissue plus\\nthe moisture evaporated from the surface of the soil. As long as the rate of root uptake of soil moisture\\nbalances the water losses from the canopy, evapotranspiration continues to occur at its potential rate.\\nWhen the rate of root water uptake falls below the transpiration demand, actual transpiration begins to\\nfall below the potential rate. This is either because the soil cannot supply water to roots quickly or the\\nplant can no longer extract water to meet the evaporation demand.\\nD.  Reference Evapotranspiration (ET0 )\\nThis represents the maximum rate of evapotranspiration from an extended surface of 8–10 centimeters\\ntall green grass cover, actually growing and completely shading the ground under limited supply of\\nwater.\\nPotential evapotranspiration (PET) - Potential evapotranspiration (PET) for any crop is obtained\\nfrom reference evapotranspiration and crop factors (K c) when water supply is unlimited.\\nPET = Kc × ET0\\nEvapotranspiration is also called water use (WU) or consumptive use (CU).

Though the cycle has neither a beginning nor an end, the concept of cycle begins with the water\\nof the oceans, since it covers nearly ¾ of the earth’s surface. Radiation from the sun evaporates the\\nwater as water vapour from the oceans into the atmosphere. The water vapour rises and collects to form\\nclouds. Under certain conditions, the cloud moisture condenses and falls back to the earth as rain, snow,\\nhail etc. Precipitation reaching the earth’s surface may be intercepted by vegetation, enter into the soil,\\nmay flow as run or may evaporate. Evapor ation may be from the surface of the ground or from free\\nwater surface. Transpiration may be from plants.\\nA.  Monsoons of India\\nThe term monsoon is derived from an Arabic word ‘Mausim’ or from Malayan word ‘monsin’ which\\nmeans ‘season’. The word monsoon is applied to such a circulation, which reverses its direction every\\nsix months i.e. from summer to winter and vice-versa. The economic significance of monsoon is\\nenormous, because a population of more than 2000 million lives, i.e., roughly about half the world’s\\npopulation (54%), depends on the monsoon rains for their crops. Moreover, a large percentage of total\\npopulation in the monsoon region derives its income from agriculture. In India, monsoon means life-\\ngiving rains. Failure of monsoon rains cause loss of food crops. Erratic behaviour of monsoon cause\\ndisastrous floods in some parts of the country while in other parts there is severe drought.\\nDuring the hot, dry season (April-May), when temperatures rise rapidly and pressures over land\\ndecrease, the warm and moist air form over the adjacent seas starts blo wing, towards the above-men-\\ntioned low pressure centre. However, in the beginning the maritime, air masses are drawn only from a\\nshort distance. But by the end of May or the first week of June, when the low pressure centre has fully\\ndeveloped, the pressure-gradient is steeped so that even the trade winds from southern hemisphere are\\ndrawn towards the thermal low positioned in north-western region of the sub-continent. The southerly\\ntrades on crossing the equator are deflected to their r ight in accordance with Ferrell’s Law. Now, the\\noriginally south-east trade winds become southwesterly blowing towards north-east. Southwesterly on-\\nshore winds blowing towards the centre of low pressure over northern India traverse thousand of miles\\nover the warm tropical ocean. They are, therefore, full of moisture and have a great potential for heavy\\nprecipitation. The south-west monsoon, as it is called in this region, is split into two branches by the\\nshape of Peninsular India. They are known as: ( a) the Arabian Sea branch, and ( b) the Bay of Bengal\\nbranch.\\n(a) Arabian Sea branch - The Arabian sea branch strikes the elevated western ghats of India at\\nalmost right angles. The windward slopes of western ghats receive heavy orographic precipita-\\ntion. However, the westerly current from the Arabian Sea continues its journey across the Indian\\nPeninsula, but the amount of rainfall on the leeward side goes on diminishing with increasing\\ndistance from the sea cost. The western gha ts have 100–250 cm of rainfall on their windward\\nslopes, while there is a well-marked rain-shadow to the leeward. Towards the north, where\\nwestern ghats are not very high, the differen ce in the amount of rainfall between the windward\\nand leeward side is rather negligible. Some of the air currents from the Arabian sea branch\\nmanage to proceed towards Chhota Nagpur plateau through the Narbada and Tapit gaps. These\\nair currents ultimately unite w ith the Bay of Bengal branch.'),\n",

This is\\nbecause of its peculiar geographical location. A current of the Bay of Bengal branch recurves\\nwestward and advances up to the gangetic plain towards the Punjab. It may be mentioned that\\nthe westward movement of monsoon current takes place around the eastern end of a trough of\\nlow pressure developed over northern India. The movement of winds is, of course, parallel to the\\nHimalayan ranges. The rainfall occurring in the Gangetic plain is partly controlled by the relief,\\nand partly by the cyclonic storms or monsoon depressions, which followed the track of low\\nrelief and low pressure along southern fringe of the plains. It is to be noted that in this region,\\nthe monsoon current blows from a south-east direction. The rainfall decreases from east to west\\nand from north to south. The main reason for decrease in amount of rainfall westwards is the\\nincreasing distance from the source of moisture. The southward decrease in rainfall is due to the\\nincreasing distance form the Himalayas, which cause the forced ascent of rain bearing air\\ncurrents.\\n(c) Winter Monsoon - A secondary high pressure system develops over Kashmir and the Punjab.\\nThe high pressure area controls the prevailing wind direction over the rest of the subcontinent.\\nContrary to the pressure condition over land, ther e are low pressure centres formed over the\\nIndian ocean, the Arabian sea, and northern part of Australia. In the cool season, therefore, there\\nis pressure gradient from land to sea as a result of which winds begin to move from land to sea.\\nThese are the north-east or winter monsoons of northern hemisphere. The southern part of\\nIndian Peninsula receives rainfall from north-east monsoon currents. These currents while traveling\\nover the Bay of Bengal pick up moisture from warm ocean surface. The amount of winter\\nrainfall on the eastern side of the peninsula is much heavier than that on the other side. It is also\\nknown as retreating monsoon.\\n4.11 FLOOD\\nYears in which actual rainfall is ‘above’ the normal by twice the mean deviation or more is defined as\\nyears of floods or excessive rainfall. Like droughts, the definition of floods also varies one situation to\\nanother and form one region to other or high degree of runoff is known as flood. Runoff is that portion\\nof precipitation that returns to the oceans and other water bodies over the land surface or through the\\nsoil and water table. The factors affecting runoff are the amount and intensity of precipitation, tempera-\\nture, characters of the soil, vegetative cover of the area and slope of the land. It may be a direct return\\nof rainfall or the flow from melted snow and ice fields-which have temporarily stored water. When rain\\noccurs, the proportion of runoff will depend on capacity of the soil and vegetation to absorb. Plants\\nretain some rainfall on their external structur es and slow the velocity of raindrops. They also detain\\nwater in its horizontal movement. Plants improve  soil structure and their roots provide channels to\\nmove water to greater depths. The high humus content of soils with dense grass cover enhances absorp-\\ntion than impervious sub-soil.\\nSome of the flood years due to high and intense rainfall in India are as follows.\\n1878, 1872, 1917, 1933, 1942, 1956, 1959, 1961, 1970, 1975, 1983, 1988, 2005, 2006\\nFlood differs from simple runoff only in degree. Distinction between the two depends upon how\\nthey affect surface features. River floods occur whenever the channel capacity is exceeded by the runoff\\ndue to excessive runoff of rainfall or snow melt. But, the channel capacity may also be affected by'),\n",

In some cases, storms occur irregularly; in others they follow a\\nseasonal pattern. Two types storms causing flood are:\\n\\x7f Violent thunder showers, which is of short duration and produces a flash flood.\\n\\x7f Prolonged wide spread rain which through sheer quantity of water, creates extensive flooding\\nover entire watersheds.\\n(b) Damages - The damages due to flood are:\\n\\x7f Loss of human life, cattle wealth and properties.\\n\\x7f Loss of field crops, soil-may vary according to the duration and intensity of flooding.\\nNot all floods are “bad” for agricultural areas in the lower-Nile flood plain and Mesopotamia\\ndepend on annual river flooding and the accompanying deposits of fertile silt.\\n(c) Management of flood - For managing flood, the following measures may be taken.\\n\\x7f Conserve water in the soil where it falls by increasing porosity of the soil and growing vegetations\\nto reduce runoff.\\n\\x7f Increase the capacity of channels (rivers) to carry excess water direct to the ocean or to the water\\nbodies for storage.\\n\\x7f Avoid silting of water courses to conserve soil by adopting soil conservation techniques such as\\nby vegetative barriers, counter bunding, contour cultivation, allowing grassy water ways etc.\\nThe most injurious aspects of flooding or too much of water are lack of aeration and reduction in\\noxygen supply.

Wet spell - A wet spell is defined as a rainy day with “X” mm of rainfall or a 7 day spell where\\nthe total amount of rainfall equals “x” mm or more and the condition that three out of these\\nseven days must be rainy with rainfall more than 2.5 mm on each day. In this, “x” is the amount\\nof rainfall, which brings the top 50 cm soil layer to field capacity. The water holding capacity\\nvaries with the type of soil.

Drought - Drought has varied meanings for different people. In general, drought may be defined\\nas a complex phenomenon, which results from  the prolonged absence of precipitation in con-\\njunction with high rate of evaporation. This causes abnormal loss of water form water bodies,\\nlowering of the water table and dehydration of the root zone of the soil, thus upsetting water\\nsupply to plants. The term drought can be defined by several ways.\\n\\x7f The condition under which crops fail to ma ture because of insufficient supply of water.\\n\\x7f The situation in which the amount of water required for transpir ation and evaporation by\\ncrop plants in a defined area exceeds the amount of available moisture in the soil.\\n\\x7f A situation of no precipitation in a rainy season for more than 15 days continuously. Such\\nlength of non-rainy days can also be called as dry spells.\\nThe details on classification of drought is given in the chapter 13 (Section 13.3 B)\\n5. Aberrations in rainfall - Aberration means the deviation from the normal behaviour of the\\nrainfall. As the principal source of water for dr y land crops is rain, a major portion of which is\\nreceived during the monsoon period. Bursts of rain alternated with “Breaks” are not uncommon.\\nThere are at least four important aberrations in the rainfall behaviour.\\n\\x7f The commencement of rains may be quite early or considerably delayed.\\n\\x7f There may be prolonged breaks during the cropping season (Intermittent drought).\\n\\x7f The rains may terminate considerably early (early cessation of rain) or continue for longer\\nperiods.\\n\\x7f There may be spatial and/or temporal aberrations.\\n(a) Early or delayed onset of monsoon  -  To quantity the aberrations in the onset of monsoon,\\n50 years of data to be analyzed for the date of onset of monsoon has to be studied for different regions\\nof the country. The aberrations require changes in crops and varieties with the normal onset of NEM\\n(Sep.–Oct.). Crops like sorghum, bajra, pulses and oil seeds can be grown in Kovilpatti tract of Tamil\\nNadu with the onset of monsoon. If monsoon is delayed up to  late October, crops like bajra, pulses,\\nsunflower etc., can be raised. If it is very much  delayed up to first week of November, crops like\\nsunflower can be sown.\\n(b) Breaks in the monsoon rains-Intermittent drought - The breaks can be of different durations.\\nBreaks of shorter duration (5–7 days) may not be a serous concern, but breaks of 2–3 weeks or even\\nmore, lead to plant-water stress causing reduction in production.

The yields of sensitive\\ncrops are seriously affected but not drought resistant crops. Another aspect of the breaks or intermittent\\ndrought is the stage of the crop at which the drought occurs. The effect on crop will be different at\\ndifferent stages. Another important factor is the effect of breaks or intermittent drought depends on the\\nphysical properties of the soil particularly its water holding capacity. Deep black soils have capacity to\\nstore as much as 300 mm of available soil moisture in one meter depth, whereas light soils can store\\nonly as little as 100 mm or so. Hence drought is more pronounced in the soils having less storage\\ncapacity.\\n(c) Early withdrawal of monsoon -  The normal withdrawal of SWM in Rayalaseema region will\\nbe between 25th September and 15th October. But, in 4% of the years out of 55 years, monsoon\\nwithdraws during first fortnight of September and in 10% of the years,  it withdraws during the month\\nof December. Since, crops and varieties in any given region are selected based on the normal length of\\ngrowing season. Persistence of rains much bey ond normal dates creates an extraordinary situation.\\nUnder Kovilpatti (Tamil Nadu) conditions, short duration bajra and sunflower will be suitable under\\nearly withdrawal of monsoon. Cultural practices to mitigate the effect of moisture stress due to inter-\\nmittent drought and early withdrawal of monsoon are: (a) shallow intercultural operations to eradicate\\nweeds, (b) maintain soil mulch to conserve soil moisture, (c) application of surface mulch, (d) thinning\\nof crops by removing alternated rows as in sorghum and bajra, (e) recycling of stored run off water, (f)\\nratooning in crops like sorghum and bajra, and (g) 2–3% urea spray after a rain for indeterminate crops\\nlike castor and red gram.\\n(d) Uneven distribution of monsoon rains, in space and time - This situation is encountered almost\\nevery year in one or another part of the country dur ing monsoon period leading to periodical drought\\nand flood situations. High variability of rainfall is the single factor whic h influences the high fluctua-\\ntions in the crop yields in the different parts of the country.\\n4.13  AGROCLIMATIC ZONES\\nClimate in general, is the totality of weather observed over wide area for a longer period. An agroclimate\\ncan be defined as the conditions and effects of varying weather parameters like solar radiation, rainfall,\\netc., on crop growth and production. Agroclimatic classification is a method of arranging various data\\nof climatic parameters to demarcate a country or region into homogenous zones, i.e., places having\\nsimilar conditions.\\nA.  Advantages\\nThe classification would enable in exploring agricultural potentiality of the area. Locating similar type\\nof climate zone will enable in identifying the specific problems of soil and climate related to\\nagriculture.

Based on the similarity in rainfall, temperature, soil topography,\\ncropping, farming system and water resources, India has been divided into fifteen agro-climatic\\nregions. This was done mainly to identify the pr oduction constraints and to plant future strategies.\\n4.14  AGROCLIMATIC NORMAL\\nCrop yields are influenced by external and internal factors that occur during the crop growing period.\\nThe external environment is the climate, which regulates and determines the growth and development\\nand final output of crop plants. But, man has no control over weather alone, because its dominance over\\nthe success or failure of agricultural enterprises. According to the WMO, the weather-induced\\nvariability in crop yields is as high as 50%. Therefore, weather should be taken as one of the inputs in\\nagricultural planning. Under optimum climatic conditions, the plants manifest their maximum growth\\nand production. Different crop growth cycles demand different climatic condition for fulfillment. Green\\nhouses where every growth factor can be controlled and growth chambers for maximum production of\\na crop are not available in plenty. Alternatively, the climate of a region where a particular crop is best\\ngrown with less pest and diseased incidence can be studied elaborately.\\nA.  Definition\\nClimatic normal means the degree of temperature, amount of rainfall, humidity, etc., which distinguish\\noptimal conditions from abnormal, both because of excess and insufficiency. The climatic normal is the\\naverage value of 30 year s of a particular weather element. The period may be a week/month and/or\\nyear. The crop distribution, production and productivity depend on the climatic normal of a place. If the\\ncrops are selected for cultivation based on the optimum climatic requirements, the crop production can\\nbe maximized. The uses of studying Agro-climatic normal for field crops can be as follows:\\n\\x7f Useful for agricultural planning.\\n\\x7f Useful in introduction of any crop.  e.g. , introduction of groundnut in peninsular India from\\nAfrica and long grained patnai rice into California.\\n\\x7f Useful to forecast the abnormal weather.\\nB.  Climatic Normal for Crop Plants\\n1. Rice\\nBesides rainfall, temperature and solar radiation influence rice yield by directly affecting the\\nphysiological processes involved in grain production and indirectly through the incidence of pest and\\ndiseases.\\nTemperature - The difference in yield is mainly due to temper ature and solar radiation received\\nduring its growing season. It requires high tempera ture, ample water supply and high atmospheric\\nhumidity during growth period. Rice tolerates up to 40°C provided water is not limiting.

For getting grain yield of 5 t/ha, a solar radiation of 300 cal.cm2/day\\nis required. A combination of low daily mean temperature and high solar radiation during reproductive\\nphase is good for getting higher yield.\\nRainfall - Rice requires high moisture and hence classified as h ydrophytes. Rice requires a sub-\\nmerged condition from sprouting to milky stage. The water requirement is 125 cm. An average monthly\\nrainfall of 200 mm is required to grow low land rice and 100 mm to grow upland rice successfully.\\n2.  Wheat\\nTemperature - Optimum temperature for sowing is 15–20oC. At maturity, it requires 25oC. At harvest\\ntime, wheat requires high temperature of 30–35 oC and bright sunny period of 9–10 hours.\\nMoisture - One ha of wheat consumes about 2500–3000 tones of water. Water deficiency at the\\nheading stage results in shriveled grains and low yield.\\n3.  Maize\\nThis crop is best suited for intermediate climates of the earth to which the bulk of its acreage is confined.\\nTemperature - Maize requires a mean temperature of 24 oC and a night temperature above 15 oC.\\nNo maize cultivation is possible in areas where the mean summer temperature is below 19 oC or where\\nthe average night temperature during the summer falls below 21 oC. However, high night temperature\\nalso results in low yield.\\nMoisture - Maize is adapted to humid climates and has high water requirements. It needs 75 cm\\nof rainfall during its growth period. The averag e consumptive use of water by maize is estimated to\\nrange between 41 and 64 cm. From germination up to the earing stage, maize requires less water.\\nHowever, at flowering, it requires more water and the requirement reduces towards maturity.\\n4.

Importance\\nWeather has many social and economic impacts in a place. Among different factors that influence crop\\nproduction, weather plays a decisive role as aberrations in it (up to 50% variations in crop production).\\nThe rainfall is the most important among the required forecast, which decides the crop production in a\\nregion and ultimately the country’s economy. The planning for moisture conservation under weak\\nmonsoon condition and for flood relief under strong monsoon condition is important in a region. A\\nreliable weather forecasting when disseminated appropriately will pave way for the effective sustainability.\\nOne can minimize the damage, which may be caused directly or indirectly by unfavourable weather.\\nThe recurring crop losses can be minimized if reliable forecast on incidence of pest and diseases is\\ngiven timely based on weather variables. It helps in holding the food grain prices in check through\\nbuffer stock operations. In good monsoon years when prices fall, the government may step in and buy,\\nand in bad years when price tend to rise, the government may unload a part of what it had purchased.\\nJudicious use of water can be planned in a region depending up on the forecast.\\nB.  Type of Weather Forecast\\nThere are three types of weather forecasting for agriculture.\\n1. Short range forecast - It is valid for 24–48 hours with 70–80% accuracy. Short range forecast\\ngives emphasis on temperature, wind velocity and directions, duration of sunshine, time and\\namount of precipitation and relative humidity. It helps in scheduling irrigation, adjusting time of\\nagricultural operations and protecting plants from frost.\\n2. Extended forecast - It is valid within 5 days with 60–70% accuracy. It gives emphasis on type\\nof weather, sequence of rainy days, normal weather, sequence of rainy days, normal weather\\nhazards in farming such as strong winds, extended dry or wet spells. This type of forecast helps\\nto determine sowing time and depth of sowing; in planning of irrigation; in making decisions on\\nharvesting and time of spraying to get higher efficiency and in managing labourers and equipments.\\n3. Long range forecast - It is valid up to 4 weeks to the season. It has emphasis in abnormality of\\ntemperature and precipitation. This forecast will be helpful in deciding soil moisture manage-\\nment, irrigation scheduling, selection of crops, managing irrigation with limited water supply\\nand deciding cropping pattern and crop yield.\\nTypes of forecast V alidity period Main users Predictions\\n1.

Accepted\\ninternational norms for measuring weather elements and representing them in international code are\\nbeing adopted by all the participating countries. There ar e about 300 meteorological observatories of\\ndifferent types, distributed all over India, for the purpose of forecasting. Recently, automatic weather\\nstations for all regions are being installed in districts by ISRO.\\nE.  Tools\\nSynoptic charts and crop weather calendar are the tools for making weather forecasts.\\n1. Synoptic charts - An enormous volume of meteorological data is being collected from all over\\nthe world continuously round the clock through various telecommunication channels. To assess,\\nassimilate and analyze the vast data, they have to be suitably presented. For this purpose, the\\nobservations are plotted on maps in standard weather codes. These maps are called ‘Synoptic\\nmaps or charts’. Synoptic charts display the weather conditions at a specified time over a large\\ngeographical area. The surface synoptic charts plotted for different synoptic hours (00, 03, 06,\\n09, 12, 15, 18, 21 UTC) depict the distribution of pressur e, temperature, dew point, clouds,\\nwinds, present and past weather. In place of GMT, UTC (Universal Time Co-ordinate) is used.\\nThe upper air charts are also prepared at the standard pressure levels of the atmosphere (different\\nheights) of the atmosphere wherein the pressure, wind and temperature are plotted. The surface\\ncharts together with the upper air charts provide a composite three-dimensional weather picture\\npertaining to a given time. Thus, it gives a birds eye view of the state of atmosphere at a time\\nover a large area and is a important tool used by operational meteorologists and scientists. The\\nsurface synoptic charts are the most used charts. It contains the maximum number of observa-\\ntions with the largest number of parameters plotted and often forms the base on which the\\npressure level charts are built up. The pattern of the pressure distribution is brought out by\\ndrawing isobars, troughs, ridges, lows, hi ghs, depressions, cyclones, fronts and discontinuities.\\nThese systems are clearly marked and labelled using appropriate symbols and colours.\\nIn synoptic charts, different weather phenomena and atmospheric characters are marked with\\ndifferent symbols as mentioned below.\\nS.No Symbols Weather element/character/phenomenon\\n1.

In India,\\nagriculture sector alone sustains the livelihood of around 67% of the population. Increasing agricultural\\nproductivity has been the main concern since scope for increasing area for cultivation is rather limited.\\nThis demands judicious and optimal management of both land and water resources. Hence, comprehen-\\nsive and reliable information on land use/cover, forest area, soils, geological information, extent of\\nwastelands, agricultural crops, water resources (surface and underground) and hazards/natural calami-\\nties like drought and floods is requir ed. Season-wise information on cr ops, their acreage, vigour and\\nproduction enables the country to adopt suitable measures to meet shortages, if any, and implement\\nproper support and procurement policies. Remote sensing systems, having capability of providing\\nregular, synoptic, multi-temporal and multi-spectral coverage of the count ry, are playing an important\\nrole in providing such information. Many experiments have been carried out in developing techniques\\nfor extracting agriculture related information fr om ground borne, air bor ne and space borne data.\\nA. Principles of Remote Sensing\\nEvery material on the earth absorbs and reflects the solar energy. In addition, they emit certain amount\\nof internal energy. The absorbed, reflected and emitted energy is detected by remote sensing instru-\\nments or sensors, which are carried in aircraft or satellites. The detections are made by characteristic\\nterms called “spectral signatures” and “images”. Remote sensing systems in common use, record radia-\\ntion in the form of electromagnetic spectrum (sunlight), i.e., visible range (0.4–0.7 nm), near infrared\\n(0.7–1000 nm) and microwaves (1nm–0.8 nm). Artificial sources of illumination such as radars are also\\nused.\\nB. Sensors Used in Remote Sensing\\nPhotography: Photographic systems are the most commonly used sensing systems. The film records the\\nenergy reaching it at the exposure time in the visible and near infrared ranges of the spectrum. The photo-\\ngraphic technique is used to identify soil types, plants grown, disease incidence and drainage patterns.\\nLine scan and related system:  The system uses the visible and near infrared portion of the spec-\\ntrum. In this system, a mirror is rotated parallel to the dir ection of the movement of the aircraft or\\nsatellite. The mirror reflects the radiation received on to  a detector and the data is recorded. The multi\\nspectral scanners have different channels for different colours of visible and IR portions. The IR sensors\\nalso record the thermal infrared radiation emitted by the earth proportional to the surface temperature.\\nThe infrared imagery is used to study the extent of ve getation, soil moisture, etc.\\nMicrowave system: The microwave radiation emitted from earth’s surface in small quantities is\\nused by microwave sensors in a wavelength of about 1 nm–1000 nm. The sensors record the microwave\\nradiation through complex antennae. These are used in weather satellites. The active microwave\\nsystems are known as radars. Radars are used to study soil characters, plant condition, soil moisture and\\nrunoff slopes.\\nC. Remote Sensing Platforms\\nThree platforms are generally used for remote sensing techniques. They are ground based, air based and\\nsatellite based. Infrared thermometer, spectral r adiometer, pilot balloons and radars are some of the\\nground-based remote sensing tools while aircrafts are air based remote sensing tools. Since the ground'),\n",

The satellites are subdivided into two\\nclasses and the types of satellite are as follows:\\n(i) Polar orbiting satellites - These satellites operate at an altitude between 550 and 1,600 km\\nalong an inclined circular plane over the poles. These satellites are us ed for remote sensing\\npurposes. LANDSAT (USA), SPOT (FRANCE), and IRS (INDIA) are some of the remote\\nsensing satellites.\\n(ii) Geostationary satellite - These satellites have orbits around the equator at an altitude of\\n36,000 km and move with the same speed as the earth, so as to view the same area on the earth\\ncontinuously. They are used for telecommunication and weather forecasting purposes. INSAT\\nseries are launched from India for the above purposes. All these satellites have sensors on board\\noperating in the visible and near infrared reg ions of the electromagnetic spectrum. INSAT-3A\\nwas launched on 10th April, 2003.\\nD.

This is mainly due to weather,\\nsoil and management factors. There is a complex reaction of weather variables among themselves as\\nwell as with other factors. Therefore, many attempts were made to study the effect of weather variables\\non crop yields through simulation modeling.\\nA. Model\\nMathematical representation of a system is called as a Model. The process of developing such represen-\\ntation is termed as modeling. In a general term, a model brings into mind the thoughts about the form\\nand functional form of real objects like children’s toy, tailors dummies and make-ups of buildings and\\nstructure to be constructed later in the real forms. Models also construct the objects or situations not yet\\nin existence in real form. A model can also be referred as a representation of relationship under con-\\nsideration and may be defined as an act of mimicry.\\nB. Crop Model\\nIt is a representation of a crop through mathema tical equations explaining the crops interaction with\\nboth above ground and below ground environment. The increase in dry matter of the crop is referred\\nto as growth. The rate of growth of a healthy crop depends on the rate at which radiation is intercepted\\nby foliage and/or on the rate at which water and nutrients are captured by root systems and therefore,\\non the distribution of water and nutrients in the soil profile. The crop development is described in terms\\nof various phenophases through which the crop completes its lifecycle. That is the progress of the crop\\nfrom seeding or primordial initiation to maturity. Finally, the yiel d of crop stand is expressed as a\\nproduct of three components viz., the period over which dry matter is accumulated (the length of the\\ngrowing period), the mean rate at which dry matter is accumulated and the fraction of dry matter treated\\nas yield when the crop is harvested. It is under stood that the crop growth, development and yield\\ndepend upon the mean daily temperature, the length of the day and the amount of solar radiation (PAR)\\nreceived by the crop.\\nMax. daily temperature Min. daily temperatureDTT Base temperature\\n2\\n+=−\\nWhere, DTT = Daily thermal time accumulation.\\nThe time needed for the crop to reach a development stage depends upon temperature measured\\nabove a base value (DTT) and for photo periodically sensitive phases such as flowering, the day length\\nabove a fixed base. In the absence of stress, the harvest index does not vary much from year to year for\\na specified variety. Therefore, crop weather modeling is based on the principles that govern the'),\n",

Types of Models\\nSimple statistical or Empirical statistical models - These models rely mainly on the statistical tech-\\nniques such as correlation or regression of the appropriate plant and environmental variables. The\\nregression co-efficient is not necessarily related to the important processes, but estimate the yield alone.\\nTherefore, many studies are required to produce the regression equations necessary for the wide spread\\napplication of this kind of models. A great advantage of these simple crop weather models is that they\\nuse readily available weather data.\\nA model based on physiological and physical aspects - These are mechanistic models where\\nplant and soil processes are described with respect to physiological or physical or chemical aspects. For\\nexample, N may be taken up from the soil by the root system depending on soil N content and rate of\\navailability to the roots. Thus, physical place of N in the visibility of root system and transformation is\\nimportant.\\nPhenological model - These models predict the crop development fr om one growth stage to\\nanother. The prediction is generall y based on the accumulated heat limits.\\nMechanistic model - These models explain not only the relationships between the weather\\nparameters and the yield, but explain the relationship of influencing dependent variables.\\nDeterministic models - These models estimate the exact value of the yield or dependent variable\\nand have defined co-efficient.\\nStochastic models - A probability element is attached to each output. For each set of inputs\\ndifferent outputs are given along with probabilities. These models define the yield or state of dependent\\nvariable at a given rate.\\nDynamic models - Time is included as a variable . Both dependent and independent variables are\\nhaving values, which remain constant over a given period of time. Over a period of time, these variables\\nare changing due to change in rate of increment.\\nStatic models - Time is not included as a variable. The dependent and independent variables\\nhaving values remain constant over a given period of time.\\nDynamic crop simulation models - These models predict changes in crop status with time. As\\nexample, model, which predicts soil water content at a certain depth throughout the season, or the one,\\nwhich predicts changing number of bolls on cotton with the season, are dynamic simulation models.\\nCrop simulation model predicts the final yield and also provides quantitative information on\\nintermediate steps like daily weight of different plant parts, which is verified through experimentation.\\nThe model acts like a real crop be gradually growing leaves, stems, roots etc., during a season.\\nIn other words, simulation is the process of using a model dynamically by following a system over\\na time period. A dynamic crop simulation model is most successfully developed by a multi-disciplinary'),\n",

Computer\\nmodels in general, are a mathematical representation of a real world system. One of the main goals of\\ncrop simulation models is to estimate agricultural production as a function of weather and soil condi-\\ntions as well as crop management. These models use one or more sets of differential equations over\\ntime, normally from planting until har vest maturity or final harvest.\\nDescriptive models - A descriptive model defines the behaviour of a system in a simple manner.\\nThe model reflects little or none of the mechanisms that are the causes of phenomena but consists of\\none or more mathematical equations. An example of such an equation is the one derived from\\nsuccessively measured weights quickly the weight of the crop wher e no observation was made.\\nExplanatory models - This model consists of quantitative description of the mechanisms and\\nprocess that cause the behaviour of the system. To cr eate this model, a system is analyzed and its\\nprocess and mechanisms are quantified separately. The model is built by integrating these descriptions\\nfor the entire system. It contains descriptions of distinct pr ocesses such as leaf area expansion, tiller\\nproduction etc. Crop growth is a consequence of these processes.\\nD. Uses of Crop Weather Modeling\\nThe models can be used as a research tool in planning alternative strategies for cropping, land and water\\nmanagement practices for a range of agro-climatic conditions. It will be helpful for economists to work\\nout cost benefit ratio analysis. It enables plant breeder to develop crop varieties tailored to different\\nagro-climatic conditions. It helps in making appropriate management decision for production and in\\nidentifying most potential area for research.\\nE. Advantages of Crop Weather Modeling\\nModeling relates plant growth and development from seedling to maturity. The variability of growth\\nand development is understood by basic concepts explained on mathematical basis. The response of\\nplants to their macro and microenvironments are quantified. It provides an understanding of the\\ndevelopment process in plants and also helps in knowing missing data to have complete picture of the\\nprocesses. It will give new ideas leading to experimental approaches. Modeling enables the researchers\\nto understand the effect of single factor and combination of several factors in one experiment. As such\\nseparate adhoc experiments can be avoided. Models will indicate priorities for applied research and will\\nhelp managers in making suitable decisions.\\n4.18 CLIMATE CHANGE AND VARIABILITY\\nA. Climate Change\\nAny permanent change in weather phenomena from the normal of a long period average is referred as\\nclimate change  e.g. , the global temperature has increased by 2.0–3.0°C and increase in CO 2 from\\n180 ppm to 350 ppm. The earth’s atmosphere has never been free of change (in its composition,\\ntemperature, self-cleaning ability). Due to change in atmosphere, the world is warming, climatic zones\\nare shifting; glaciers are melting and sea level is rising.\\nB. Climate Variability\\nThe temporal changes in weather phenomena, which is part of general circulation of atmosphere and\\noccurs on a yearly basis on a global scale.\\nClimate change and climate variability are the concern of human kind in recent decades all over the\\nworld.

Canada and New England in the U.S. suffered heavily due to ice storm in January while\\nTurkey, Argentina and Paraguay with floods in June 1998. V ast fires in Siberia burned over three million\\nacres of forests. Human and crop losses are the worst phenomena in such weather disasters, affecting\\nglobal economy to a considerable extent. In 2004, nobody can forget the Tsunami problem in\\nIndonesia, India, Sri Lanka and other Asian countries.\\nThe 1997-98 El-Nino events, the strongest of the last century is estimated to have affected 110 million\\npeople and cost the global economy nearly US $ 100 billion. Statistics compiled from insurance companies\\nfor the period 1950-1999 show that major natural catastrophes that are mainly weather and climate related\\ncaused estimated economic losses of US $ 960 billion.

Effects of Climate Change\\nThe increase in concentration of CO2 and other green house gases are expected to increase the tempera-\\nture of the earth. Crop production is weather dependant and any change will have major effects on crop\\nproduction and productivity. Elevated CO2 and temperature affects the biological process like respira-\\ntion, photosynthesis, plant growth, reproduction, water use etc. Depending on the latitude, the CO2 may\\neither offer beneficial effect or may behave otherwise also.\\n1. Greenhouse effect - The theory of “greenhouse effects” was conceived by J.B. Fourler over a\\ncentury ago. It was supported by Tyndall’s studies on the absorption of heat by gases. The\\nSwedish Svante-Arrhenius had calculated in 1896 that there would be a global warming by\\n3.2-4.0oC due to doubling of CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere.

This is similar to what occur in a green house,\\nwhere the glass on the roof is transparent to solar radiation but absorbs long wave radiation. Due\\nto this analogy the term “green house effect” has been given. Increased human activities increase\\ncarbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) etc., which lead to increase\\nin temperature and sea level rise.

The global impact of these changes could be very large.\\nThe first issue and the cause of some major problems in the future, the depletion of the ozone layer,\\nthreatens the inhabitants of Earth due to the advent of harmful ultraviolet radiation. The second issue,\\nglobal warming and the plight of Antarctica, involves the melting of polar ice caps threatening our\\ncoastal regions in the future. The third issue, electric cars, may or may not be the solution to major\\nenvironmental problems 50 years in the future. We hope that by exploring our website, you will be\\nenlightened about these three issues concerning the future of our planet in the year 2050.\\nThe depletion of the Ozone layer - The ozone is a thin layer of atmosphere that protects us from\\nthe sun. It wraps all the way around the Earth, about 10 to 30 miles straight up. From the beginning of\\ntime, the ozone has blocked the sun’s most dangerous ultraviolet rays from reaching us. It continues to\\ndo so even today. Each ozone molecule is made up of three small oxygen atom s that act like a safety\\nnet to catch most of the UV rays and keep them from getting down to the Earth’s surface. There’s been\\na problem in the last few decades though. The ozone layer is being depleted with the higher usage of\\nproducts that emit chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC’s. Right now, only a small region of Antarctica is\\nactually covered by ozone because such a large hole is forming over the area. The ozone layer is\\nthinning even over more heavily populated areas like North Amer ica and Australia.\\nWhat Depletes the Ozone Layer?\\nThe depletion of ozone is caused by the release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-\\ndepleting substances (ODS). Some common ODS are refrigerants, insulating foams, and solvents. The\\nfollowing focuses mostly on CFCs, but is relevant to all ODS. Although CFCs are heavier than air, they\\nare eventually carried into the stratosphere in a process that can take as long as 2 to 5 years. Measure-\\nments of CFCs in the stratosphere are made with the help of balloons, aircraft, and satellites. When\\nCFCs reach the stratosphere, the ultraviolet radiation from the sun causes them to break apart and\\nrelease chlorine atoms which react with ozone, starting chemical cycles of ozone destruction that\\ndeplete the ozone layer. One chlorine atom can break apart more than 100,000 ozone molecules.'),\n",

As methyl bromide\\nand halons are broken apart, they release bromine atoms, which are 40 times more destructive to ozone\\nmolecules than chlorine atoms. CFCs and other ODS are heavier than air. In a still room, they would\\npool on the floor, but the atmosphere certainly not still. Numerous measurements have proven that these\\nmolecules are mixed nearly uniformly throughout all the trophosphere over the entire earth. In the same\\nway that vinegar and oil normally separate when still, but mix when shaken, ozone depleting substances\\nand air are thoroughly stirred together by winds in the troposphere.\\nGlobal Warming: Problems for Antarctica\\nThis heating of the earth might cause many problems in the future if not stopped. The higher tempera-\\ntures will melt the polar ice caps, and that means that  the sea level will increase. The sea level has\\nalready risen around 4 to 10 inches in the past 100 y ears. A higher sea level might wash out beaches\\nall over the world and inundate seaside cities and to wns that are at or below sea level.\\n1. Preventing global warming - There are things that we as people in society can do to prevent\\nfurther global warming. We can try to emit the least possible amounts of greenhouse gases. We\\ncan do this by carpooling, using more efficient cars or electrical cars, not purchasing aerosol\\nproducts and by getting our air conditioners serviced annually. Another simple way to help is to\\nturn off electrical appliances when they are not being use. This will reduce the amount of\\nelectricity being consumed and allow power plants to reduce the amount of fossil fuels being\\nburned. The burning of fossil fuels release enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmos-\\nphere. Plants, on the other hand, use carbon dioxide for photosynthesis so the more plants and\\ntrees we plant, the less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. One acre of lawn removes one ton of\\ncarbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and other air pollutant s in one year. The problem is that many\\nrainforests are being razed to make way for cattle grazing and cows are one of the largest sources\\nof methane. Other forests are being burned down (which by itself creates more carbon dioxide)\\nto make room for the increasing population. We  must control the population explosion as well\\nto prevent more global warming. The more aware every individual is, the more will be\\ncontributed to stopping the increase of global warming. If we try to reduce the greenhouse gases\\nbeing emitted, we can save Antarctica and prevent other disasters and changes of temperature\\nthat will affect the coastal regions and the rest of the environment.\\n2. EL Nino and La–Nina - El-Nino is a Spanish word meaning “the boy child” (‘Child Christ’)\\nbecause El-Nino occurs around Christmas time each year when the water of the Peruvian coast\\nwarm slightly. In every 3–6 years, the water becomes unusually warm. ‘El Niño’ is now used\\nmore widely to refer to this abnormal warming of the ocean and the resulting effects on weather.\\n‘El Niño’ is often coupled with ‘Southern Oscillation’ as the acronym ENSO. ‘La Niña’ is used\\npopularly to signify the opposite of El Niño, occurring when the waters of the eastern Pacific are\\nabnormally cold. La Niña episodes are associated with more rainfall over eastern Australia, and\\ncontinuing drought in Peru. Pe ruvian meteorologists have objected to term La Niña-the Girl\\nChild-because Christ is not known to have had a sister, and the term anti-ENSO is sometimes\\npreferred.\\nThe El-Nino event is due to decrease in atmospheric pressure over the South East Pacific Ocean.\\nAt the same time, the atmospheric pressure over Indonesia and North  Australia increases. Once the\\nEl-Nino event is over, the atmospheric pressure over t he above regions swings back. This sea-saw\\npattern of atmospheric pressure is called Southern Oscillation.

A measure of the monsoon low pressure is the Southern Oscillation Index\\n(SOI) represented by the difference in sea level pressure over Tahiti, an Island in South central pacific\\nand Darwin in North Australia, which represents the northern part of the Indian Ocean. The positive\\nSOI denotes high pressure over the central pacific and low over Indonesia, North Australia and\\nNorthern Indian Ocean. Above average rainfall is expected over India and Indonesia and North Aus-\\ntralia if the SOI is positive. Drought or deficit rainfall is expected in the above countries if the SOI is\\nnegative, indicating high atmospheric pressure over Indonesia and low in the central pacific.\\nSir Gilbert Walker 1920, discovered there is a see-saw pattern in the atmospheric pressure between\\nthe Pacific ocean and Indian ocean. Where the pressure was high over the Southern Pacific, it was low\\nover the Indian ocean, but once in every few years, the pressure pattern was re versed, that is, the\\npressures over the Indian ocean because high, while lower pressures prevailed over Southern pacific.\\nSir Gilbert called it the Southern Oscillation, Dr. Bjerknes 1958–59 who found that the Southern\\nOscillation was closely linked to the sudden appearance of warm waters off coastal park in South\\nAmerica-due to raise in sea surface temperature. This abnormal warming of sea surface in off the coast\\nof few and equator is called El nino, which is highl y related, with Southern Oscillations and these two\\nphenomenon are collectively called ENSO. It has highly variable effect on global and Indian weather.\\nEL-Nino (warm phase) event has a negative correlation with Indian SWM rainfall, while positive\\nassociation with NEM rainfall in extreme peninsular India.\\nTowards the end of 1972 as series of catastrophic events in different parts of the world drew\\nattention to their possibility of global teleconnection in weather, the monsoon off 1972 was poor-severe\\ndrought in Northern Africa.

They are: (i) Mineral matter, (ii) Organic matter, (iii) water, and\\n(iv) air. Physically, soil consists of stones, large pebbles, dead plant twigs, roots, leaves and other parts\\nof the plant, fine sand, silt, clay and humus derived from the decomposition of organic matter. In the\\norganic matter portion of the soil, about half of the organic matter comprised of the dead remains of the\\nsoil life in all stages of decomposition and the remaining half of the organic matter in the soil is alive.\\nThe living part of the organic matter consists of plant r oots, bacteria, earthworms, algae, fungi, nema-\\ntodes actinomycetes and many other living organisms.\\nFig. 5.1\\nSoil contains about 50% solid space and 50% pore space. Mineral matter and organic matter\\noccupy the total solid space of the soil by about 45% and 5% respectively. The total pore space of the\\nsoil is occupied and shared by air and water on roughly equal basis. The proportion of air and water will\\nvary depending upon the weather and environmental factors.\\n(a) Soil mineral matter (SMM) - Size and composition of mineral matter in soils are variable due\\nto nature of parent rock from which it has been derived. The rock fragments are disintegrated and\\nbroken portion of the massive rocks, from which regolith through weathering, the soil has been formed.\\nThese materials are usually very coarse and the minerals are extremely variable in size. The primary\\nminerals viz., quartz, biotite, muscovite (dominates coarse fractions of the soil) and the secondary\\nminerals viz., silicate clays and hydrous oxides clays of iron and aluminium (as very fine fraction) are\\npresent.\\n(b) Soil organic matter (SOM) -  Soil organic matter exists as partly decayed and partially\\nresynthesized plant and animal residues. These are continuously being broken down as a result of\\nmicrobial activity in soil. Due to constant change, it must be replenished to maintain soil productivity.\\nThe organic matter content in a soil is very small and varies from only about 3–5% by weight in topsoil.\\nIn addition to partly decayed plant and animal residues, soil organic matter contains living and dead\\nmicrobial cells, microbiologically synthesized compounds and derivatives.\\nImportance\\n\\x7f Organic matter is a storehouse of nutrients in soil.

Water is\\nheld within the soil pores with varying degree of forces depending upon the amount of water present.\\nWith the increasing amount of water in soil, the forces of retention of water by the soil will be low and\\nvice-versa. The movement and retention of water in the soil is primarily influenced by the characteris-\\ntics of the soil viz., texture, nature of inorganic and organic colloids, type and amount of exchangeable\\ncations, size and total amount of pore spaces etc. Water held by soil with high force of attraction is not\\navailable to the plants. Soil water along with dissolved salts makes up the soil solution. These soil\\nsolution acts as an important medium for supplying dif ferent nutrient elements through exchange\\nphenomena between soil solid surface and soil solution and the plant roots.\\n(d) Soil air -  Pore spaces in soil consist of that portion of the soil volume not occupied by soil\\nsolids, either mineral or organic. Under field condition, pore spaces are occupied by air and water; the\\nmore the water the less the room for air and vice-versa. The relative amounts of air and water in the pore\\nspace fluctuate continuously. During rainy season, water replaces air from the soil pore spaces, but as\\nsoon as water leaves by downward movement, surface evaporation, and transpiration etc., air gradually\\nreplaces the water, as it is lost form the pore spaces. Soil air contains various gases like CO2, very small\\namounts of O2 and N etc. Generally, soil air contains much more CO2 and small amount of O2 than that\\nof atmospheric air due to microbial respiration when large amounts of CO2 releases into the air and O2\\nis taken up by soil microorganisms. Well-aggregated soil having large pore spaces offers less\\nmechanical impedance to root developments and shoot emergence and do not form crusts easily. Good\\naeration occurs in well-drained soils, which have sufficient proportion of their volume occupied by\\npores. Cultural practices affect soil aeration and plant growth through modification of different soil\\nphysical properties like bulk density, porosity, aggregation etc. Soil air also influences beneficial\\nmicroorganisms in soil.\\n5.1.1 Solid Phase\\nThe solid phase is made of minerals, or ganic matter and various chemical compounds.\\n(a) Mineral - The mineral particles are the chief components of most soils. They consist of remains\\nof parent rock and particles developed in situ by weathering or deposited in bulk by wind or\\nwater force. The proportion and sizes of these particles determines the soil texture.\\n(b) Organic matter - The organic fraction consists of both plant and animal matter in two phases\\neither alive or in different stages of decomposition as discussed above. It varies from 1-5% by\\nweight in different soils. Normally in tropics, red soil contains less than 1% and heavy soil up\\nto 2%.\\n(c) Chemical compounds - The chemical components of soils are made of silica and silicates. It\\nvaries from profile to profile; generally the larger particles contain more silica content and finer\\nparticles contain more of potassium, calcium and phosphorus. The dominant minerals are quartz\\nin sand, quartz and feldspars in fine sand and silt, vermiculite, montmorillonite, kaolinite and\\namorphous colloids in clay. Oxides, carbonates and sulphates are the other common minerals\\npresent in the soil.'),\n",

This is known\\nas soil water, which is stored in the space between soil particles known as pore space. This pore space\\nis the most important physical structure and plays a vital role in irrigation studies. Plants absorb water\\nfrom the pore spaces and hence this water must be replenished by  rain or irrigation water for the\\nsuccessful growth of crops. Hence, the soil serves as a reservoir for moisture.\\n5.1.3 Gaseous Phase\\nThe spaces in between soil particles are not only filled with water, but some spaces are occupied with\\nair. The soil air differs from atmospheric air in its composition. Soil air contains less O 2 content and\\nmore CO2 than atmospheric air, because of the respiration of soil microorganisms and plant roots in\\nwhich oxygen is consumed and carbon dioxide is released. So, the pore spaces enclosed by soil matrix\\nare shared by soil-air and soil-water. As the amount of one increases, that of the other decreases.\\nTable 5.1.

Importance in irrigation management\\nIt plays a vital role in permeability of water and water movement, gaseous exchange capacity, root\\ngrowth, water holding capacity of soil and water supplying capacity to the plants. All the above func-\\ntions are determined by the predominant soil particles  viz., sand, silt and clay.\\n(i) Stones and gravel - If stones and gravels are present < 10 percent, it reduces evaporation,\\nfacilitates good drainage, and results in easiness for the workability of tillage and intercultural\\nimplements. If stones and gravels are present > 10 percent, Soil will be too open and loose; It\\npermits rapid drainage; It reduces soil water retention capacity and Indirectly it leaches the soil\\nnutrients.\\n(ii) Sand - If sand particles are about 40 per cent, the soil will be open and fr iable which favours\\noptimum retention capacity of soil water, optimum gaseous exchange and optimum drainage. If\\nsand particles are > 40%, it causes rapid evaporation, excess drainage and percolation and poor\\nwater holding capacity.\\n(iii) Silt - If silt content is 30–40 percent, it provides a good loamy condition, w hich favours opti-\\nmum water holding capacity and optimum draina ge. If silt content is > 40%, it causes poor\\ndrainage.\\n(iv) Clay - The clay content should be < 50% for irrigated crops. If clay content is more than this,\\nit will lead to poor drainage and stagnation of water, poor gaseous exchange and high water\\nholding capacity.\\n5.2.1.2 Soil Structure\\nIt is defined as the shape and arrangement of soil particles with respect to each other in a soil mass or\\nblock. The soil aggregates are not solids but possess a porous or spongy character. Most soils are having\\na mixture of single grain structure or aggregate structure. The number of primary particles (sand, silt\\nand clay) is combined together by the binding effect of organic and inorganic soil colloids. The binding\\nor cementing materials are: Iron or Aluminium Hydroxide and decomposing organic matter. The names\\nof soil structures based on their shapes are: 1. Platy, 2. Prismatic, 3. Columnar, 4.

These spaces, which are not occupied by the soil particles, are known as pore space.\\nA. Role and its importance\\nIt constitutes about 40 to 60% of soil in volume basis. It provides space for water and air circulation and\\nit plays a vital role in irrigation management. There are two types of pore spaces viz. , micro pore and\\nmacro pore. There is no sharp line of demarcation between the macro and micro pores. The macro pores\\nallow the ready movement of air and permeability of water freely. In contrast, the micro pore air\\nmovement is greatly difficult and water movement is restricted to slow capillary movement. The vol-\\nume of pore spaces varies according to the texture, structure and organic matter content. Soils having\\nbig particles contain less pore space than those having small particles. Thus the volume of pore space\\nin an enclosed container having big particles is less than that of small particles. The size of individual\\npores is highly important for the movement of water in soil than the percentage of total pore space in\\nsoil. For example, percentage of pore space is high in clay soil, which contains more micropores where\\nwater movement is highly restricted and thereby water-holding capacity is more.

Addition of organic matter increases the volume of pore space by\\nlowering the bulk density. Similarly mechanical manipulation or stirring of soil, decomposition of\\nvegetation, root penetration, etc., increase the pore spaces. If macropores are more in top layer,\\n(0–30 cm depth) it is desirable for easy movement of air and water and rapid infiltration of water.\\nBetween 30 and 150 cm depth, equal amount of macro and micropores are essential to allow\\nsufficient moisture, and permit moderate percolation to lower layer, which acts as storage reservoir.\\nBelow 150cm depth mostly micropores are desirable so as to help to:\\n\\x7f retain more moisture.\\n\\x7f To replenish the moisture in the upper la yer whenever it is depleted.\\n\\x7f To restrict deep percolation loss.\\nB. Void ratio or relative porosity\\nIt is the ratio of volume of pores to the volume of solids alone. Here the above ratio between the volume\\nof pores to volume of solids alone excluding of pore space is taken for consideration. Porosity is the\\ncomparison between the volume of pores to the total volume of soil i.e., including pore space is given\\nconsideration. Hence this index has certain advantage and accuracy over porosity.\\nCapillary and non-capillary pores - The soil pores are also classified as capillary and non-\\ncapillary pores based on their role in the movement of water or conductance of water.\\n(i) Capillary pores - They retain the water after gravitational drainage of water is ceased or stopped.\\nThis water available to plants is held with the forces of cohesion, adhesion and surface tension.\\nHere the capillary porosity is the percentage that is occupied by capillary water.\\n(ii) Non capillary pore space - This is also termed as aeration pores. Non-capillary pores are large\\npore spaces and do not hold water with tension. Since the water movement is not restricted, its\\nmovement is relatively high and thereby the pore space cannot hold water except condition of\\nsaturation. Generally, this pore space is occupied with soil air. Hence, non-capillary porosity is the\\npercentage of pore space filled with air. The large non-capillary porosity of sandy soil results in\\nbetter drainage and aeration with low water holding capacity than the clay soil whereas the clay soils\\nhave larger proportion of small capillary pores which restricts the movement of water and hence\\nwater holding capacity is high but drainage is difficult. An ideal soil has pore space of equal\\namount of capillary and non-capillary pores and solids and pore spaces in equal proportion.\\n5.2.2 Soil/irrigability Classification\\nSoil is the reservoir for water in retaining and supplying the soil moisture to plant growth. The periodi-\\ncal recharging of water in soil pore spaces can be made either by irrigation or rainfall. The recharged\\nwater has to be supplied to plant system. This retention capacity and supply capacity varies from soil\\nto soil based on its physical and chemical pr operties. Based on this, soil classification is made for its\\nsuitability for irrigation. This classification is also kno wn as irrigability classification. Generally, soil\\ncan be broadly grouped as shallow soil and deep soil.\\n(i) Shallow soil - It means the actual depth of soil profile to hold moisture is very less and depth\\nof soil medium available for plant to extend its  root system for ta pping water and nutrients is\\nless.\\n(ii) Deep soil - The soil profile depth is more to hold moisture and the depth of soil medium\\navailable for plant roots to extend its branches to tap water and nutrients is also more.

Water is retained as thin film around the soil particles and in the\\ncapillary pores by the forces of adhesion, cohesion and surface tension.\\nA.  Adhesion\\nIt is the force of attraction between molecules of diffe rent substance. That is the force of attraction\\nbetween solid surface (soil mass) to liquid surface (soil water). A thin film of water is held in soil\\nparticles due to this adhesive force.\\nB.  Cohesion\\nCohesion is the force of attraction between molecules of same substances i.e., between liquid molecules\\nor water molecules. Hence, a thick film of water is formed due to this cohesive force.\\nC.  Surface Tension\\nIt is the total force acting in a solid-liquid-air system. The liquid surface has some properties of stretched\\nelastic nature. This is due to the unequal forces of molecular attraction at the surface layer. This\\nelasticity is known as surface tension. In other words, surface tension is defined as the “Force pulling\\ntangentially along the surface of a liquid”. This force tends to make the surface area as small as possible\\nand has the dimension of force per unit length or ener gy per unit area e xpressed in Newton/meter (N/\\nm) or dynes/cm. As a result of this surface tension, the air-water interspace become curved.\\nD.  Soil moisture tension\\nSoil moisture tension is the tenacity with which water is held in the soil. To remove this water, some\\npressure (force per unit area) must be given or exerted. This pressure or tenacity is measured in terms\\nof potential energy of water and is e xpressed in atmosphere or bars.\\n1 atmosphere = 1036 cm water column or 76.39 cm of mercury\\n         1 Bar = 1023 cm water column\\nTo convert the soil moisture tension to equivalent atmosphere, the above conversion ratio can be used.'),\n",

Hence, it can be stated as suction or\\nnegative pressure. Hence, soil moisture tension of one atmosphere is approximately equal to suction or\\na negative pressure of 1000 cm of water column. At different soil moisture constants the soil moisture\\ntension will vary. For example, the loam or cl ay type of soil retains moisture at a tension of 1/3\\natmosphere at field capacity level, whereas the sandy soil has a tension of as low as 1/10 atmosphere.\\nThe available soil moisture is not only the function of soil physical character istics like texture and\\nstructure but also the soil depth.\\nE.  Kinds of Soil Water\\nThe soil water can be classified based on their nature of attachment to the soil particles.\\n\\x7f Hygroscopic water\\n\\x7f Capillary water\\n\\x7f Gravitational water\\nFig. 5.5 Kinds of soil water\\n1. Hygroscopic water  - This is the first stage of soil water content where water is held tightly by\\nthe surface of the soil particles by the forces of adhesion or adsorption force. Hence, it is also\\nknown as water of adhesion. At this condition the tension with which water is held in soil surface\\nis from 10,000 atmosphere to 31 atmosphere. So the plant cannot exert this much of energy to\\nextract the water from the soil particles. Hence, it is the unavailable form of water. This condi-\\ntion mostly occurs at permanent wilting point stage or dry condition.\\n2. Capillary water -  This is the next stage after attaining hygroscopic water, with reference to\\nsoil-water relationship. In this stage there is relatively better thick film of water around the soil\\nparticles and between the soil particles. Hence, the cohesi ve force is responsible for the attrac-\\ntion of water molecules with each other. At this condition some of the pore spaces are not filled\\nwith water. Only the micro pores are filled up with water and little chances for macro pores to\\nhold water. This condition will appear at field capacity level where the water is held at a tension\\nof one-third atmosphere to 15 atmosphere. The water is available to the plants because plants\\nZone of progressive thickening of water film\\nTension of thinnest\\nfilm - 10,000 atoms\\nSoil-liquid interface\\nSoil-liquid\\nWater of adhesion\\n(Hygroscopic water)\\nTension of thickest\\nfilm - 1/3 atoms\\nWater of cohesion\\n(Capillary water)\\nHygroscopic coeff.\\nabout 31 atoms.\\nSome water almost subject to gravity\\nflow thru macropores\\n(Gravitational water)'),\n",

Hence, it is known as available water.\\nWhen water comes in contact with the surface of soil particles, it will be attracted by the surface\\nof the soil by adhesive force and gravitational force. At the same time there is repulsion for this\\nattraction due to cohesive force along the liquid surface. This elasticity is known as surface\\ntension. Due to the surface tension, the liquid tries to move tangentially along the water surface.\\nThis movement is called capillary water movement and the available water to plant is decided\\nby the capillary water, which will be the function of pore space, which again depends upon the\\nsoil texture, structure and organic matter.\\nTexture - Finer the texture greater is the capillary capacity.\\nStructure - Granular structure produces higher capillary capacity\\nOrganic matter - More organic matter increases the capillary capacity\\n3. Gravitational water - It is the third stage of soil water where water that moves freely as\\nresponse to gravity percolates downwards and drains out to deeper layer of soil profile. It is also\\nknown as free water. At this condition, the macro and micro pores are completely filled up with\\nwater. There is no space for air movement in  soil pore spaces. This state will appear when the\\nsoil is under saturation.\\n5.3 SOIL CLASSIFICATION\\nAny classification helps to understand the subject in question systematically and effectively with\\nreference to all characteristics. Soil taxonomy groups the soil in orderly and logical and hierarchical\\nmanner involving successive sub divisions. Modern soil taxonomy considers soil and natural body and\\nhas two major features.\\n\\x7f The classification system is based on all soil properties which can easily be verified by other\\nscientists, and\\n\\x7f The unique nomenclature has given a connotation or expression of major characteristics of the\\nsoil.\\nPurpose\\n\\x7f Besides attempting the genetic relationship,  it helps to communicate all scientists with a specific\\nlanguage, which is a shorthand impression on the nature of the soil profile.\\n\\x7f It helps the soil scientists to remember the soil properties very easily.\\n\\x7f It easily establishes the relationship between soil individuals.\\n\\x7f It predicts the soil behaviour with re ference to the purpose for which put into.\\n\\x7f It identifies the soils best uses.\\n\\x7f It also helps to estimate the soil productivity and helps to identify soils for research and agro\\ntechnology transfer.\\nIn order to establish the interrelationship between soil characteristics, the soils require to be clas-\\nsified.

Red sandy soils have\\ndeveloped from acidic parent material like granite , gneiss, quartzite, sandstone etc. The red colour of\\nsoils is due to the coating of ferric oxides on soil particles. Sand particles are coated with red coloured\\nhematite or yellow coloured limonite, which is responsible for the various shades of red and yellow of\\nthese soils, which usually contain ferruginous gravel containing iron, aluminium and silica. These\\nsandy, loamy sand and sandy loam soils are heavily leached and therefore, poor in basic elements and\\nplant nutrients. Their pH ranges from 6.6-8.0. Calcium is the important exchangeable cation in these\\nsoils. They are neutral to slightly alkaline in reaction.\\n5.5.1 Black Soils or Vertisol\\nAbout 18 lakh ha occurs in all districts except Kany akumari and Nilgiris. The soils are deep black\\ncotton soil and old alluvial soils. Soils are very deep, clay ey calcareous and poorly drained, develope\\ncracks during summer, contains high amount of Ca, Fe and Mg. CaCO3 is present in the form of Kankar\\nnodules. Poor in organic matter, N and P, but fairly well supplied with K and lime. The soil reaction is\\nmild alkaline (pH: 7.8-8.2) CEC is high (30-70 c. mol (p+) kg-1). Black soils of Tamil Nadu, which are\\neither shallow (3-4 ft, deep) or deep, are of very heavy texture, have a high moisture retention capacity,\\nand are rich in lime and alkaline in reaction. They contain low amounts of nitrogen but sufficient\\namounts of phosphoric acid and potash. Mixed red and black soils occur in Coimbatore, Madurai,\\nRamanathapuram and Tirunelveli districts. Black soils are dominated by beidellite, while red soils are\\ndominated by kaolinite. So the cation exchange capacity of red soils is maximum at an intermediate\\ndepth.'),\n",

The pH\\nis usually less than 8.5. Formerly these soils were called white alkali soil because of surface curst of\\nwhite salts. The saline soils are originating due to accumulations of soluble salts. The most soluble salts\\nin saline soils are composed of the cations sodium, calcium, magnesium and the anions chloride,\\nsulphate and bicarbonate. Usually smaller quantities of potassium, ammonium, nitrate and carbonate\\nalso occur.\\nA. Sources of Soluble Salts\\nThere are various sources from which soluble salts are accumulated in the soil.\\n(a) Primary minerals - During the process of chemical weathering (hydrolysis, hydration, solution,\\ncarbonation and oxidation) various constituents like Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+ are gradually released\\nand made soluble.\\n(b) Arid and semi arid climate - Salt affected soil are mostly formed in arid and semi arid regions\\nwhere low rainfall and high evaporation prevails.\\n(c) Ground water - If ground water contains large amounts of water soluble salts, irrigation of such\\nwater leads to accumulation of salts in soil.\\n(d) Ocean or seawater  -  Seawater enters into the land by inundation and deposited on the soil\\nsurface as salts. In arid regions near the sea, appreciable amount of salts are blown by wind year\\nafter year and get deposited on the surface soil. The salinity of Rajasthan are mostly developed\\nthrough this source.\\n(e) Excessive use of basic fertilizers - Use of basic fertilizers like sodium nitrate, basic slag etc. may\\ndevelop soil alkalinity.\\nB. Genesis/Origin\\nThe process by which the saline soil formed is called ‘salinization’. Saline soils occur mostly in arid or\\nsemi arid regions, which have very low rainfall and high evaporation. The low rainfall in these regions\\nis not sufficient to leach out the soluble products of weathering and hence the salts accumulate in the\\nsoil. During rainy season the salts dissolve in rainwater and move down to lower layers. However, due\\nto limited rainfall, the downward movements are restricted to a short distance only. In dry weather, the\\nsalts move up with the water and are brought up to the surface where they are deposited as the water\\nevaporates. With alternate downward and upward movements of rainwater, the salts get concentrated in\\nthe surface layer and form a ‘white’ efflorescence’.'),\n",

Substantial quantities of soluble salts are still present in the soil body\\nand hinder plant growth. The growing of salt tolerant plants with a view to remove salts is also not a\\npractical proposition. Although these plants remove fairly substantial quantities of salts from the soil,\\ncomparatively larger quantities are still left behind. Salt formation is a continuous process, hence the\\nreclamation is never complete.\\n(a) Leaching requirement (LR) - It may be defined as the fraction of the irrigation water that must\\nbe leached through the root zone to control the soil salinity at any specified level.

When e xcess soluble salts accumulate in these soils, sodium\\nfrequently becomes the dominant cation in the soil solution. In arid regions as the solution becomes\\nconcentrated through evaporation or water absorption by plants, the Ca 2+ and Mg2+ are precipitated as\\nCaSO4, CaCO3 and MgCO3, with a corresponding increasing of sodium concentration.

Reclamation\\n(a) Conversion - As alkali soil contains Na-clay, it gets dispersed and becomes sticky and impervi-\\nous as soon as the salts are washed out. As a result, the downward movement of water stops and\\nthe soil gets waterlogged. Thus in the case of such soil it is necessary to remove the exchange-\\nable sodium before the removal of soluble salts so that the physical condition of the soil is not\\nimpaired. While removing exchangeable sodium, the presence or absence of calcium carbonate\\nin the soil has to be taken into consideration. If the soil has no reserve CaCO 3, the addition of\\nCaSO4 (Gypsum) is necessary.\\n(b) Gypsum Requirement (GR) - The main principle for the reclamation of sodic soil is to replace\\nexchangeable sodium by another cations say Ca2+. Of all calcium compounds, gypsum (CaSO4,\\n2H2O) is considered to be the best and cheapest for the reclamation purpose. Gypsum require-\\nment is determined from the formula\\n() ( )ESP initial ESP final CECGR 100\\n−×=\\nwhere,\\nESP (initial) is obtained from soil analysis before reclamation\\nESP (final) is usually kept at 10 since this value is considered safe for tolerable physical condi-\\ntions of the soil\\nCEC-cation exchange capacity (meq/100 g)\\nWhen gypsum is applied to alkali soil, the following reaction will take place.

Highly permeable soils\\nThe high permeability is associated with sand and loamy sand texture of soils. These oils occur in\\ncoastal areas, river delta and in the desert belts.

So whatever the nutrients and\\nwater added to these soils are not utilized by the crops and subjected to loss.\\n\\x7f Soils are lighter in colour.\\n\\x7f V ery low in organic carbon, nitrogen and medium in P and K.\\n\\x7f Low nutrient diffusivity and buffering capacity.\\nRemedial measures - To correct the textural weakness of these sandy soils and to make them\\nsuitable for sound farming, various ameliorative measures have been devised.\\n\\x7f Introduction of artificial barriers in the subsoil zone using asphalt, bitumen and cement have been\\nfound to arrest the higher rate of nutrient and water losses in sandy soils. This technology is costly.\\n\\x7f Compaction technology - The soils should be ploughed uniformly. About 24 hours after a good\\nrainfall (or) irrigation, the soil should be rolled 10 times with 400 kg stone roller of 1 m long (or)\\nan empty tar drum filled with 400 kg sand. This practice increases the bulk density of 0-30 cm\\nlayer to optimum range (1.5-1.7 mg/m 3). Then, shallow ploughing should be given and crops\\ncan be raised.'),\n",

Slowly permeable soils\\nThe slow permeable soil is mainly due to very high clay content and poor drainage conditions which\\nresults in poor aeration and water stagnation and ultimately leads to poor crop growth and in certain\\ncase leads to complete death of crops. The slow permeability of the soil is mainly associated with black\\nclay soils.

Interception of drainage channels of about 50 cm\\nwide and 15 cm deep provides effective surface drainage.\\n\\x7f Raised and sunken beds formation in between adjacent raised beds : The bulk density was\\nfound to be reduced due to increase in non-capillary pores in upper 10 cm layer of raised bed\\nbesides increase in yield of crops by forming raised and sunken beds. The 6–12 m wide and\\n20 cm high raised beds alternating with 6 m wide sunken beds provides in situ drainage. The\\nraised beds are constructed by r emoving the soil from the sunken beds.\\n\\x7f Formation of broad beds: To reduce the amount of water retained in black clay soils during first\\n8 days of rainfall, broad beds of 3–9 m wide should be formed either along the slope (or) across\\nthe slope with drainage furrows in between broad beds.\\n\\x7f The productivity of sodic clay soils can be increased to a significant extent through use of\\ngypsum and agricultural grade iron pyrites.\\n\\x7f Long term application of organic manures along with chemical fertiliz er under well aerated\\ncondition improves the available status of nutrients.\\n3. Subsoil hard pans\\nThe reasons for the formation of subsurface hard pan in red soils is due to the illuviation of clay to the\\nsubsoil horizons coupled with cementing action of iron, aluminium an calcium carbonate.

Soil surface crusting\\nSurface crusting is due to the pr esence of colloidal oxides of iron and aluminium in Alfisols, which\\nbinds the soil particles under wet regi mes. On drying it forms a hard mass on the surface. The alluvial\\nsandy loam soils in Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal form a crust on\\nthe soil surface, which interferes with germination and growth of crops. The red sandy loam soils\\n‘Chalkas’ which cover a large area of Andhra Pradesh become very hard on drying with the result that\\nthe crop growth is adversely affected. In Tamil Nadu, this problem is prevalent mostly in red soil areas\\n(Alfisols) and is of greater magnitude in districts like Trichy, Pudukottai, Ramnad and Tirunelveli. The\\ncrusting of soils is directly related with aggregate stability, rainfall characteristics and its chemical\\ncomposition. The poorly aggregated soil particles in alluvial, red and lateritic soils disintegrate easily\\nunder the impact of rain drops. The quantity of dispersed soil increases with the increase in drop size,\\ndrop velocity and rainfall intensity. The hydration of aggregates causes a disruption through the process\\nof swelling and explosion of entrapped air.

Fluffy paddy soils\\nThe traditional method of preparing the soil for transplanting rice consists of puddling. This results in\\nsubstantial break down of soil aggregates into a structure less mass. The solid and liquid phases of the\\nsoil are thus changed. Under continuous flooding and submergence in rice-rice-rice sequence, the soil\\nparticles are always in a stage of flux and the mechanical strength is lost leading to the fluffiness of the\\nsoils.

During\\norganic matter decomposition, humus, organic acids and different acid salts may be produced\\nwhich increases the total acidity of soil.\\nAluminosilicate minerals - At low pH values most of the aluminium (Al) is present as the hydrated\\naluminium ions (Al3+), which undergoes hydrolysis and release hydrogen (H+) ions in the soil solution.\\nAl3+ +H 2O ⎯⎯ → Al(OH)2+ +H +\\nAl (OH)2+ +H 2O ⎯⎯ → Al(OH)2\\n+ +H +\\nAl (OH)2\\n+ +H 2O ⎯⎯ → Al(OH)3\\n0 +H +\\nAl (OH)3\\n0 +H 2O ⎯⎯ → () 4Al OH\\n− +H +\\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) - Root activity and other metabolism may serve as sources of CO 2, which\\nultimately leads to acidity in soil.

Due to increase in organic matter\\ncontent in the soil, the population of soil microbes increases and very rapidly use the soil oxygen\\nand results in reduced soil condition. As a result of reduction, the n utrient elements like Mn 4+\\nand Fe3+ reduce to Mn 2+ and Fe2+ respectively and toxicity of these elements develops.

N, P and S become less available in acid soil having pH less than 5.5.\\n(e) Microbial activity - Bacteria and actinomycetes function better in soils having moderate to high\\npH values. They can not sustain their activity when the soil pH drops below 5.5.

Before drainage,\\nthese soils may have normal pH and if soils undergo  aeration the pH will be reduced and hence they\\nare called “potential acid sulphate soils”.

In India, acid sulphate soil is mostly found in Kutanad (Kerala),\\nOrissa, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal.\\nA. Formation\\nLands inundated with water that contain sulphates particularly salt water, accumulate sulphur com-\\npounds, which in poorly aerated soils are bacterially reduced to sulphides. Such soils are not usually\\nacidic when first drained in water. When the soil is drained and then aerated, the sulphide (S 2) is\\noxidized to sulphate (SO4) by a combination of chemical and bacterial actions, forming sulphuric acid\\n(H2SO4). The magnitude of acid development depends on the amount of sulphide present in soil,\\nconditions and time of oxidation.\\nReactions involving the formation of acid sulphate soils  - Acid sulphate soils are formed due to\\noxidation of sulphides in soils. The slow oxidation of mineral sulphides in soils is non biological until\\nsoil pH reaches to 4.0.\\nMicrobial\\n22 2 4 oxidation2S 3O 2H O H SO++ ⎯ ⎯ ⎯ ⎯ →\\nMicrobial\\n22 2 4 oxidationHS 2 O HS O+⎯ ⎯ ⎯ ⎯ →\\n(Hydrogen sulphide)\\nNon-biological\\n22 2 42 42FeS 2H O 7O 2FeSO 2H SO++ ⎯ ⎯ →+\\n(Iron pyrite)                              (Ferrous sulphate)\\nAccelerated by bacteria ( Thiobacillus ferroxidans)'),\n",

H2S often formed in low land rice soils causing “akiochi” disease\\nthat prevents rice plants roots from absorbing nutrients.\\nC. Management\\nMaintaining the reduced condition of flooded (anaerobic) soil inhibits acid development.\\n(a) Controlling water table  -  If a non-acidifying layer covers the sulphur ic horizon, drainage to\\nkeep only the sulphuric layer under water (anaerobic) is possible.\\n(b) Liming and leaching - Liming is the primary way to reclaim any type of acid soil. Acid soil may\\nrequire 11-45 MT/ha of lime in a 20-year period whereas, acid sulphate soil may require from\\nseveral metric tones per hectare per year upto even 224 metric t/ha (100 t/ac) within a 10 year\\nperiod. If these soils are leached during early years of acidification, lime requirements are\\nlowered. Leaching however is difficult because of the high water table commonly found in this\\ntype of soil and low permeability of the clay.\\n5.7.3 Soil Survey\\nSoils are non-renewable natural resource of any country. A through knowledge of a soil is very essential\\nfor making all kinds of land use policies. To frame such land use policies, an inventory of soil resources of\\na country should be made first. Preparation of such inventory starts with soil survey. Without soil survey\\neffective, land development projects, irrigation projects, development of wild life sanctuaries, parks laying\\nout transport facilities cannot be executed property. The soil survey helps us in several ways. At national\\nlevel, soil survey helps to prepare soil resource inventory and overall land related policies and plans. At state\\nlevel, it is basic to form land related development schemes. It is also useful to delineate agricultural,\\nforestry wastelands etc. At town level, soil survey reports are of immense use for town planning or\\nlocating areas for residential building, roads, parks, waste disposal sites, other sanitation facilities etc.,\\nIn an agro climatic region, soil survey helps us in locating research stations and in identifying repre-\\nsentative soils for conducting field experiment, on farm trials and demonstr ation plots.

Once the area to be surveyed is communicated to the soil survey authority, the first step in the\\nsoil survey is the collection of top sheet and preparation of base maps. The second step involves the\\norganizing the survey team. Usually, there will be 2 scientists, a driver and 1 or 2 technicians. The team\\nrapidly traverse the area to get overall picture of geology, physiography, land use etc., and prepare a\\npreliminary legend. After the area visit, the preliminary legend will be reviewed and modified if\\nnecessary. This forms the pre-survey exercise. The next stage in the soil survey forms the pre-survey\\nexercise in the field. Using the map again, the entire area is traversed to note physiographic relationship.\\nWherever necessary and whenever available cross section of road cuts, dug well, open quarries are\\nexamined visually, the soils are examined with augers. The broad soil series and its associations are\\ndemarcated on the map and legends are finalized. Location of master profiles is selected and examined\\nfor various morphological characteristics, and given in soil survey description sheet. Horizon wise soil\\nsamples are collected for laboratory studies. Soil boundaries are checked with auger samples and field\\nexamination is completed. All data regarding land use pattern, crops and cropping sequence, industries,\\nirrigation sources, education, socio economic status, ecosystem in general are collected from all avail-\\nable sources.\\n(a) Post field activities  - In the laboratory, the soil samples are analyzed usually for pH, EC,\\navailable N, P, and K etc. If the survey sponsor insists other analysis for special purposes, analysis for\\nsuch characteristics are also carried out and profile sheets are edited and finalized. The various data\\ncollected from various sources are compiled and tab ulated, and appropriate interpretations are made.\\nThe maps are finalized to demarcate the soil series.\\n(b) Grid survey - In grid survey, survey is taken in a larger area. The ar ea is divided into number\\nof grids and traverse line located on a grid pattern. Generally 4–5 obser vations per ha. Comparable\\nobservations were connected and mapped.\\n(c) Free survey -  Here, the surveyor selects the observation points and observes the change in\\nphysiography using the aerial photographs.

This condition occurs when the water consumed by the crop\\nis in equilibrium with rainfall and water storage in the soil. The growing season for a rainfed crop\\ninvolves three different periods during which the soil moisture conditions depend on the rainfall\\nreceived.\\n(a) Pre-humid period:  During this period the precipitation will always remain lower than the\\npotential evapotranspiration for the corresponding period. This period corresponds to the sowing\\nperiod of the crop. Sowing can be done when the precipitation during the week is > 0.5 PET.\\n(b) Humid period: During this second period the precipitation remains higher than the PET. The\\ncrops in this period will be in active vegetative and flowering phase and the water requirement\\nwill be at its peak. At the end of this per\\niod water balance is on the positive side and the water\\nstorage in the soil is on the increase, since the rainfall is higher than the water needs.\\n(c) Post-humid period: This period follows the humid period. During this period there is a gradual\\nreduction in the water stored in the soil due to the utilization by the crop plants. The crops will\\nalso make use of the rainfall received. This period usually coincides with maturity stage of the\\ncrop.'),\n",

Types of growing period\\nThere are four types of growing period.\\n1. Normal: In this type, rainfall is in excess during the humid period. At the end of the pre-humid\\nperiod when precipitation is higher than the 0.5 PET sow ing the crops are taken up. This type\\nof growing season is prevalent in semi arid tropics.\\n2. Intermediate type: The precipitation is lower that the PE T all round the year . The growing\\nseason is limited to the period when rainfall is in excess of 0.5 PET. Only drought hardy crops\\nlike pearl millet, castor, etc., can be grown. Dry farming is highly risky.\\n3. All year round humid:  In this type, the precipitation is more  than PET all round the year,\\nindicating the moisture sufficiency for cropping. This type occurs in high rainfall areas and\\nmostly perennial crops are raised.\\n4. All year round dry: The precipitation is lower than 0.5 PET throughout the year. Cropping is\\nnot possible in these areas. This type of growing season is found in extremely arid areas, mostly\\nthe deserts.\\nThe fluctuations in the crop yields depend on the following conditions.\\n\\x7f The length of the rainy seasons  i.e., from sowing to the end of the rains.\\n\\x7f The quantity and distribution of rains during the pre-humid and humid periods.\\n\\x7f The excess rainfall during humid period should go to soil storage. It may cause water\\nlogging and crop lodging.\\n\\x7f The amount of rainfall received during post humid season, may supplement the soil mois-\\nture during maturity.

The word tillage is derived from the\\nAnglo-Saxon words tilian and teolian, meaning to plough and prepare soil for seed to sow, to cultivate\\nand to raise crops. Jethrotull, who is considered as Father of tillage suggested that thorough ploughing\\nis necessary so as to make the soil into fine particles.\\n7.0 DEFINITION\\nTillage refers to the mechanical manipulation of the soil with tools and implements so as to create\\nfavourable soil conditions for better seed ge rmination and subsequent growth of crops.\\nTilth is a physical condition of the soil resulting from tillage. Tilth is a loose friable (mellow), airy,\\npowdery, granular and crumbly condition of the soil with optimum moisture content suitable for work-\\ning and germination or sprouting of seeds and propagules i.e., tilth is the ideal seed bed.\\n7.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF GOOD TILTH\\nGood tilth refers to the favourable physical conditions for germination and growth of crops. Tilth\\nindicates two properties of soil viz., the size distribution of aggregates and mellowness or friability of\\nsoil. The relative proportion of different sized soil a ggregates is known as size distribution of soil\\naggregates. Higher percentages of larger aggregates with a size above 5 mm in diameter are necessary\\nfor irrigated agriculture while higher percentage of smaller aggregates (1–2 mm in diameter) are desir-\\nable for rainfed agriculture. Mellowness or friability is that property of soil by which the clods when\\ndry become more crumbly. A soil with good tilth is quite porous and has free drainage up to water table.\\nThe capillary and non-capillary pores should be in equal proportion so that sufficient amount of water\\nand free air is retained respectively.\\n7.2 OBJECTIVES\\nTillage is done:\\n\\x7f To prepare ideal seed bed favourable f or seed germination, growth and establishment;\\n\\x7f To loosen the soil for easy root penetration and proliferation;\\n\\x7f To remove other sprouting materials in the soil;\\n\\x7f To control weeds;\\n\\x7f To certain extent to control pest and di seases which harbour in the soil;'),\n",

On Season Tillage: It is done during the cropping season (June–July or Sept.–Oct.).\\n2. Off Season Tillage: It is done during fallow or non-cropped season (summer).\\n3. Special Types of Tillage: It is done at any time with some special objective/purpose.\\n7.4.1 On Season Tillage\\nTillage operations done for raising the crops in the same season or at the onset of the crop season are\\ncalled as on season tillage. They are,\\nA. Preparatory Tillage\\nIt refers to tillage operations that are done to pre pare the field for raising crops. It is divided into three\\ntypes viz., (i) primary tillage, ( ii) secondary tillage, and ( iii) seed bed preparation.\\n(i) Primary tillage - The first cutting and inverting of the soil that is done after the harvest of the\\ncrop or untilled fallow, is known as primary tillage. It is normally the deepest operation\\nperformed during the period between two crops. Depth may range from 10–30 cm. It includes\\nploughing to cut and invert the soil for further operation. It consists of deep opening and\\nloosening the soil to bring out the desirable tilth. The main objective is to control weeds to\\nincorporate crop stubbles and to restore soil structure.\\n(ii) Secondary tillage - It refers to shallow tillage operation that is done after primary tillage to\\nbring a good soil tilth. In this operation the soil is stirred and conditioned by breaking the clods\\nand crust, closing of cracks and crevices that form on drying. Incorporation of manures and\\nfertilizers, leveling, mulching, forming ridges and furrows are the main objectives. It includes\\ncultivating, harrowing, pulverizing, raking, leveling and ridging operations.\\n(iii) Seed bed preparation - It refers to a very shallow operation intended to prepare a seed bed or\\nmake the soil to suit for planting. Weed control and structural development of the soil are the\\nobjectives.'),\n",

Inter Tillage/Inter Cultivation\\nIt refers to shallow tillage operation done in the filed after sowing or planting or prior to harvest of crop\\nplants i.e., tillage during the crop stand in the field. It in cludes inter cultiva ting, harrowing, hoeing,\\nweeding, earthing up, forming ridges and furrows etc. Inter tillage helps to incorporate top dressed\\nmanures and fertilizers, to earth up and to prune roots.\\n7.4.2 Off Season Tillage\\nTillage operation is done for conditioning the soil during uncropped season with the main objective of\\nwater conservation, leveling to the desirable grade, leaching to remove salts for soil reclamation reduc-\\ning the population of pest and diseases in the soils. etc. They are:\\n(a) Stubble or Post harvest tillage - Tillage operation carried out immediately after harvest of crop\\nto clear off the weeds and crop residues and to restore the soil structure. Removing of stiff\\nstubbles of sugarcane crop by turning and incorporating the trashes and weeds thus making the\\nsoil ready to store rain water etc., ar e the major objectives of such tillage operations.\\n(b) Summer tillage - Operation being done during summer season in tropics to destroy weeds and\\nsoil borne pest and diseases, checking the soil erosion and retaining the rain water through\\nsummer showers. It affects the soil aggregates, soil organic matter and sometimes favour wind\\nerosion. It is called as Kodai uzavu in Tamil Nadu state.\\n(c) Winter tillage - It is practiced in temperate regions where the winter is severe that makes the\\nfield unfit for raising crops. Ploughing or harrowing is done in places where soil condition is\\noptimum to destroy weeds and to improve  the physical condition of the soil and also to incor-\\nporate plant residues.\\n(d) Fallow tillage - It refers to the leaving of arable land uncropped for a season or seasons for\\nvarious reasons. Tilled fallow represent an extreme condition of soil disturbance to eliminate all\\nweeds and control soil borne pest etc. Fallow tilled soil is prone to erosion by wind and water\\nand subsequently they become de graded and depleted.\\n7.4.3 Special Types\\nSpecial type tillage includes\\n(i) Subsoil tillage (sub soiling) is done to cut open/break the subsoil hard pan or plough pan using\\nsub soil plough/chisel plough. Here the soil is not inverted. Sub soiling is done once in\\n4–5 years, where heavy machinery is used for field operations and where there is a colossal loss\\nof topsoil due to carelessness. To avoid closing of sub soil furrow vertical mulching is adopted.\\n(ii) Levelling by tillage - Arable fields require a uniform distribution of water and plant nutrition for\\nuniform crop growth. This is achieved when fields are kept fairly leveled. Levellers and scrapers\\nare used for levelling operations. In leveled field soil erosion is restricted and other management\\npractices become easy and uniform.\\n(iii) Wet tillage - This refers to tillage done when the soil is in a saturated (anaerobic) condition. For\\nexample puddling for rice cultivation.\\n(iv) Strip tillage - Ploughing is done as a narrow strip by mixing and tilling the soil leaving the\\nremaining soil surface undisturbed.\\n(v) Clean tillage - Refers to the working of the soil of the entire field in such a way no living plant\\nis left undisturbed. It is practiced to control weeds, soil borne pathogen and pests.\\n(vi) Ridge tillage - It refers to forming ridges by ridge former or ridge plough for the purpose of\\nplanting.'),\n",

It is often a form of non-inversion tillage that retains protective amounts of\\ncrop residue mulch on the surface. The impor tant criteria of a conservation tillage system are:\\n(i) presence of crop r esidue mulch, ( ii) effective conservation of soil and water, ( iii) improve-\\nment of soil structure and organic matter content, and ( iv) maintenance of high and economic\\nlevel of production (refer section 7.10 of this chapter).\\n(viii) Contour tillage - It refers to tilling of the land along contours (contour means lines of uniform\\nelevation) in order to reduce soil erosion and run off.\\n(ix) Blind tillage - It refers to tillage done after seeding or planting the crop (in a sterile soils) either\\nat the pre-emergence stage of the crop plants or while they are in the early stages of growth so\\nthat crop plants (cereals, tuber crops etc.) do not get damaged, but extra plants and broad leaved\\nweeds are uprooted.\\n7.5 FACTORS AFFECTING (INTENSITY AND DEPTH OF) THE TILLAGE\\nOPERATIONS\\nSeveral factors are responsible for deciding intensity and depth of tillage operations. They are soil type,\\ncrop and variety, type of farming, moisture status of the soil, climate and season, extent of weed\\ninfestation, irrigation methods, special needs and economic condition, and knowledge and experience\\nof the farmer.\\n(i) Crop - It decides the type, intensity and depth of tillage operations with small sized seeds like\\nfinger millet, tobacco etc. Require a f ine seedbed which can provide intimate soil-seed contact\\nas against coarser seed bed required for larger size seeds such as sorghum, maize, pulses, etc.\\nRoot or tuber crops require deep tillage whereas rice requires shallow puddling.\\n(ii) Soil type - It dictates the time of ploughing. Light soils require early and rapid land preparation\\ndue to free drainage and low retentive capacity as against heavy soils.\\n(iii) Climate - It influences soil moisture content, draught required tilling and the type of cultivation.\\nLow rainfall and poor water retentive capacity of shallow soil do not permit deep ploughing at\\nthe start of the season. Heavy soils developing cracks during summer (self tilled) need only\\nharrowing. Light soils of arid regions need coarse tilth to minimize wind erosion.\\n(iv) Type of farming - It influences the intensity of land preparation. In dry lands, deep ploughing\\nis necessary to eradicate perennial weeds and to conserve soil moisture. Repeated shallow tilling\\nis adequate under such intensive cropping.\\n(v) Cropping system - In involves different crops, whic h need different types of tillage. Crop\\nfollowing rice needs repeated preparatory tillage for obtaining an ideal seedbed. Crops follow-\\ning tuber crops like potato require minimum tillage. Similarly crops following pulses need lesser\\ntillage than that of following sorghum, maize or sugarcane.\\n7.6 DEPTH OF PLOUGHING\\nDesirable ploughing depth is 12.5–20 cm. Ploughing depth varies with effective root zone depth of the\\ncrops. Ploughing depth is 10–20 cm to shallow rooted crops and 15–30 cm to deep-rooted crops. Deep\\nploughing is done to control perennial weeds like Cyanodon dactylon and to break soil hard pans. Since\\ndeep ploughing increases the cost, most farers re sort to shallow ploughing only.\\n7.7 NUMBER OF PLOUGHING\\nIt depends on soil conditions, time available for cultivation between two crops, (turn over period) type'),\n",

Three numbers of puddling\\nis sufficient for rice cultivation. Minimum numbers of ploughing are taken up at optimum moisture\\nlevel to bring favourable tilth depending on the need of the crop and financial resources of the farmer.\\nIn fact, this brought the concept of minimal tillage or zero tillage systems.\\n7.8 TIME OF PLOUGHING\\nThe time of ploughing is decided based on moisture status and type of soil. The optimum moisture\\ncontent for tillage is 60% of field capacity. Ploughing at right moisture content is very important.\\nSummer ploughing (March–May) can be practiced utilizing summer showers to control weeds and\\nconserve soil moisture. Light soils can be worked under wide range of moisture. Loamy soils can be\\neasily brought to good tilth. Pulverization of clay soils is difficult as they dry into hard clods.\\n7.9 METHOD OF PLOUGHING\\nPloughing aims at stirring and disturbing the top layer of soil uniformly without leaving any unploughed\\nstrips of land. Straight and uniformly wide furrows give a neat appearance to the ploughed field. When\\nthe furrows are not straight or when the adjacent furrows are not uniformly spaced, narrow strips of land\\nare left unploughed. The correct inter furrow space is little over the width of the furrow slice. After the\\nharvest of a crop the land is first ploughed along the length of the field. This reduces the number of turns\\nat the headlands for opening fresh furrows. The next ploughing is done across the field for breaking\\nfurrows of the previous ploughing. This must increase the turns at the headlands and the empty turns\\nalong the headlands, but is unavoidable. New turns are taken 6 m wide each time, till the entire field is\\ncovered.\\n7.10  MODERN CONCEPTS OF TILLAGE\\nIn conventional tillage combined primary and secondary tillage operations are performed in preparing\\nseed bed by using animal or tractor, which cause hard pan in sub soils resulting in poor infiltration of\\nrain water, thus it is more susceptible to run off and soil erosion. Farmers usually prepare fine seed bed\\nby repeated ploughing, when the animal of the farm is having less work. Research has shown that\\nfrequent tillage is rarely beneficial and often detr imental. Repeated use of heavy machinery destroys\\nstructures, causes soil pans and leads to soil erosion. Mo reover energy is often wasted during tillage\\nprocesses. All these reasons led to the development of modern concepts namely the practices like\\nminimum tillage, zero tillage, stubble mulch farming and conser vation tillage, etc.\\n7.10.1 Minimum Tillage\\nMinimum tillage is aimed at reducing tillage to the minimum necessary for ensuring a good seedbed,\\nrapid germination, a satisfactory stand and fa vourable growing conditions. Tillage can be reduced in\\ntwo ways by omitting operations, which do not give much benefit when compared to the cost, and by\\ncombining agricultural operations like seeding and fertilizer application.\\n(a) Advantages (especially in coarse and medium textured soils)\\n\\x7f Improved soil conditions due to decomposition of plant residues in situ.\\n\\x7f Higher infiltration caused by the vegetation present on the soil and channels formed by the\\ndecomposition of dead roots.\\n\\x7f Less resistance to root growth due to improved structure.'),\n",

This point\\nholds good only in temperate regions. Contrary to this in tropics, minimum tillage recommended\\nto conserve organic matter in the soil.\\n\\x7f Nodulation is affected in some leguminous crops like peas and broad beans.\\n\\x7f Sowing operations are difficult with ordinary equipment.\\n\\x7f Continuous use of herbicides causes pollution problems and dominance of perennial\\nproblematic weeds (weed shift).\\n\\x7f Minimum tillage can be achieved by the following methods:\\n(a) Row zone tillage - Primary tillage is done with mould board plough in the entire area of the\\nfield, secondary tillage operations like discing and harrowing are reduced and done only in\\nrow zone.\\n(b) Plough-plant tillage - After the primary tillage a special planter is used for sowing. In one\\nrun over the field, the row zone is pulv erized and seeds are sown by the planter.\\n(c) Wheel track planting - Primary ploughing is done as usual. Tractor is used for sowing, the\\nwheels of the tractor pulverize the row zone in which planting is done.\\n7.10.2 Zero Tillage/No Tillage/Chemical Tillage\\nZero tillage is an extreme form of minimum tillage. Primary tillage is completely avoided and\\nsecondary tillage is restricted to seedbed preparation in the row zone only. It is also known as no-tillage\\nand is resorted to places where soils are subjected to wind and water erosion, timing of tillage operation\\nis too difficult and requirements of energy and labour for tillage are also too high. Weeds are controlled\\nusing herbicides. Hence, it is also referr ed as chemical tillage. There ar e two types of zero tillage.\\n(a) Till Planting is one method of practicing zero tillage. A wide sweep and trash bars clear a strip\\nover the previous crop row and planter–opens a narro w strip into which seeds are planted and\\ncovered. In zero tillage, herbicide functions are extended. Before sowing, the vegetation present\\nhas to be destroyed for which broad spectrum non-selective  herbicides with relatively short\\nresidual effect (Paraquat, Glyphosate etc.) are used and subsequently selective and persistent\\nherbicides are needed (Atrazine, Alachlor etc.).\\n(b) Sod planting or sod culture:  Sod refers to top few centimeters of soil permeated by and held\\ntogether with grass roots or grass-legume roots. Planting of seeds in sods without any tillage\\noperation is known as sod culture or sod seeding . Usually legumes or small grains are\\nmechanically placed directly into a sod.\\nAdvantages\\n\\x7f Zero tilled soils are homogenous in structur e with more number of earthworms. These soil\\nphysical properties are apparent after two years of zero tillage.\\n\\x7f The organic matter content incr eases due to less mineralization.\\n\\x7f Surface runoff is reduced due to the presence of mulch.'),\n",

Sweeps or blades are generally used to cut the soil up to 12 to 15 cm\\ndepth in the first operation after harvest and the depth of cut is reduced during subsequent operations.\\nWhen unusually large amount of residues are present, a disc type implement is used for the first\\noperation to incorporate some of the residues into the soil.\\nTwo methods are adopted for sowing crops in stubble mulch farming.\\n\\x7f Similar to zero tillage, a wide sweep and trash-bars are used to clear a strip and a narrow\\nplanter-shoe opens a narrow furrow into which seeds are placed.\\n\\x7f A narrow chisel of 5–10 cm width is worked through the soil at a depth of 15–30 cm leaving all\\nplant residues on the surface. The chisel shatters tillage pans and surface crusts. Planting is done\\nthrough residues with special planters.\\nDisadvantages\\n\\x7f The residues left on the surface interfere with seedbed preparation and sowing operations.\\n\\x7f The traditional tillage and sowing implements or equipments are not suitable under these conditions.\\n7.10.4 Conservation Tillage\\nThough it is similar to that of stubble mulch tillag e, it is done to conserve soil and water by reducing\\ntheir losses.\\nModern tillage methods are practiced in western countries especially in USA. In India, it is not\\nsuitable due to several reasons. In USA, straw and stub bles are left over in the field but in India, it is\\na valuable fodder for the cattle and fuel for the home. Use of heavy machinery in India is limited and\\ntherefore, problem of soil compaction is rare. The type of minimum tillage that can be practiced in India\\nis to reduce the number of ploughings to the minimum necessary i.e.,  unnecessary repeated\\nploughings/harrowing can be avoided.\\n7.11 TILLAGE IMPLEMENTS\\nAny device used to carry on some work is called as implement. Implements are operated by animal\\npower or by machinery. Implements are classified into primary, secondary and intercultural, depending\\non the purpose for which it is being used.\\n7.11.1 Primary Tillage Implements\\nPrimary tillage is the deepest operations/performed during the period between two crops. The following\\nare the implements used for primary tillage.\\n1. Country/wooden/Desi plough - The indigenous plough consists of a wooden body to which a\\nhandle and a shaft pole are attached. The body is made of a bent piece of hard wood with two\\narms making an angle of about 135°. It is giv en a wedge shape with an isosceles triangular\\nsection.

Reversible disc plough - It is constructed in such a way that t he disc can be reversed and the\\nsoil is thrown on one side. The land and furr ow wheel adjust themselves properly when the\\nplough is reversed. Reversible disc plough sa ves time taken up by ordinary disc plough. The\\nfurrow slice cut at each trip by the reversible disc plough is laid over the previous furrow thus\\nresulting in a leveled field after ploughing.\\n8. Chisel plough or subsoil plough -  It is bullock drawn implement used to break hardpan that\\nexists in the soil due to continuous same type of operation. It consists of a curved chisel “C” like\\ntyne with 37 cm radius of curvature and 3 cm thickness. It is rigidly held in a frame, which is\\nprovided with a handle and a shaft pole. The operation of this plough is the same as that of an\\nordinary plough. It makes a simple vertical cut in the sub soil up to a depth of 45 cm and\\nfacilitates the downward movement of water and sub soil drainage. Chiseling becomes necessary\\nin soil with hard impermeable plough pan. Both animal drawn (coverage 2 ha/day) costs\\nRs. 1200/- and tractor drawn (coverage 5 ha/day) costs Rs. 6000/- are available for usage.\\n7.11.2 Secondary Tillage Implements\\nSecondary tillage is the shallow operation performed after the primary tillage. Secondary tillage imple-\\nments are used for breaking clods and producing a loose, friable, smooth state.

The following are some of them.\\n7.11.4.1 Multipurpose tool bar/carrier\\nThe multipurpose tool carrier is used for primary, secondary and intercultural operations, forming\\nbunds, ridges and furrows and for sowing crops in rows. It is suitable for all soils. A multipurpose tool\\ncarrier is made up to G.I. tube, which has the provision to attach cultivators (4 Nos.), ploughs (3 Nos.),\\nridger (2 Nos.), seed drill (4 Nos.) and bund formers (2 Nos.). The spacing between rows is adjustable.\\nThe field capacity of plough is 1.2 ha/day, while f or cultivator and ridger, it is about 0.74 ha/day.\\n7.11.4.2  Land leveling implements\\n(a) Buck scraper - It is a bullock-drawn implement made up of steel sheets like an open box with\\na bottom and three sides; the fourth side is left open. Two flat steel runners are provided at the\\nbottom to protect the base and prevent the steel plate from being worn-out while leveling. Two\\nhandles are fixed at the sides f or assisting in filling the box with  earth and for emptying the\\ncontents. The drawbar is attached to the sides with hinge arrangement. It is a bullock drawn\\nimplement very useful to carry the soil to a long distance while levelling.\\n(b) Levelling board - It is a channel like or trapezoidal shaped wooden board with 2-2.75 m length\\nand 20 cm diameter. It is attached to the shaft pole with a hinged hook. It is used for levelling\\nrice fields after the final ploughing to facilitate uniform seed germination. When the operator\\nstands over the board; it sinks lightly into the loose mud and when it moves, the soil in front of\\nit is also moved, but is released when he gets down.\\n(c) Wooden float - It is a bullock drawn implement with a long sledge-like drag used for land\\nsmothering. By working the field with wooden float three or four times lengthwise, crosswise\\nand diagonally the field is smoothen in a better way.\\n7.11.4.3  Land shaping implements\\n(a) Ridge plough - It is a bullock or tractor drawn implement. It is a double mould board plough\\nwith mould boards on both the sides, which meet along a central line. The mould boards are\\neither fixed or adjustable so that the width of the furrow can be adjusted. The ridge plough lays\\nthe earth on both the sides equally, leaving an open furrow in the middle. It forms furrows and\\nnot ridges. However, when the furrows are close to one another; the inter furrow spaces take the\\nform of ridges but when furrows are formed apar t for planting sugarcane, cotton, etc., the inter\\nfurrow spaces take the form of ridges but when furrows are formed apart for planting sugarcane,\\ncotton, etc., the inter-furrow spaces take the form of raised flat beds.\\n(b) Bund former - This consists of a pair of opposing wings, which are wide apart in front and\\nconverge towards the rear with a gap at the end. The wings gather loose soil from the surface and\\nleave it in the form of bund with approximately 18-20 cm in height. To form reduced size bunds,\\nthe wings are lightly raised at the fore end and pulled a little backward. When the implement is\\nhitched near the yoke, a small quantity of earth alone is gathered. The gaps formed at the\\nintersection of long and cross bunds while working with the implement are closed with manual\\nlabour. Ridges for sowing cotton and similar crops are also formed with bund former, with the\\nbunds close to one another as when irrigation channels are formed.'),\n",

Germination does not occur until the seeds attain physiological maturity.\\nWater (soil moisture and seed moisture):  Imbibitions of water is the prerequisite process for\\ngermination. Both living and dead seeds imbibe water and swell. Dead seeds imbibe more water and\\nswell rapidly as compared to good seeds. The amount imbibed is related to the chemical composition\\nof the seed such as proteins, mucilage’s  pectins and biochemical components. Cereal grains such as\\nmaize imbibe water to approxima tely 1/3 of its seed weight, soybean seeds to 1/2 of its seed weight.\\nSeed germination will be maximum when the soil moisture level is at field capacity. Slower rate of\\ngermination is noticed in places where soil moisture is near or at wilting point.\\nTemperature: The cardinal temperature (Maximum, optimum and minimum temperature) for\\ngermination of some of the crops is given below; The optimum temperature is that one gives the highest\\ngermination percentage in the shortest period of time.\\nTable 8.1.

Direct seeding may be done by\\n(a) Broadcasting (b) Dibbling\\n(c) Drilling (d) Sowing behind the country plough\\n(e) Planting (f) Transplanting\\n(a) Broad casting - Broad casting is the scattering or spreading of the seeds on the soil, which may\\nor may not be incorporated into the soil. Broadcasting of seeds may be done by hand,\\nmechanical spreader or aeroplane. Broadcasting is the easy, quick and cheap method of seeding.\\nThe difficulties observed in broadcasting are uneven distribution, improper placement of seeds\\nand less soil cover and compaction. As all the seeds are not placed in uniform density and depth,\\nthere is no uniformity of germination, seedling vigour and establishment. It is mostly suited for\\nclosely spaced and small seeded crops.\\n(b) Dibbling - It is the placing of seeds in a hole or pit made at a predetermined spacing and depth\\nwith a dibbler or planter or very often by hand. Dibbling is laborious, time consuming and\\nexpensive compared to broadcasting, but it r equires less seeds and, gives rapid and uniform\\ngermination with good seedling vigour.\\n(c) Drilling - It is a practice of dropping seeds in a definite depth, covered with soil and compacted.\\nSowing implements like seed drill or seed cum fertilizer drill are used. Manures, fertilizers, soil\\namendments, pesticides, etc. may be applied along with seeds. Seeds are drilled continuously or\\nat regular intervals in rows. It requires more time, energy and cost, but maintains uniform\\npopulation per unit area. Rows are set according to the requirements.\\n(d) Sowing behind the country plough - It is an operation in which seeds are placed in the plough\\nfurrow either continuously or at required spacing by a man working behind a plough. When the\\nplough takes the next adjacent furrow, the seeds in the previous furrow are closed by the soil\\nclosing the furrow. Depth of sowing is adjusted by adjusting the depth of the plough furrow. e.g.,\\nground nut sowing in dry land areas of Tamil Nadu.\\n(e) Planting - Placing seeds or seed material firmly in the soil to grow.\\n(f) Transplanting - Planting seedlings in the main field after pulling out from the nursery. It is done\\nto reduce the main field duration of the crops facilitating to grow mo re number of crops in an\\nyear. It is easy to give extra care for tender  seedlings. For small seeded crops like rice and ragi\\nwhich require shallow sowing and frequent irrigation for proper germination, raising nursery is\\nthe easiest way.\\nPre-monsoon sowing\\nNormally, sowing is taken up after receipt of sufficient amount of rainfall (20 mm) in the case of dry\\nland farming. Since sowing is continued for two or three days after a soaking rain, certain amount of\\nmoisture is last during the period between the receipt of  rainfall and sowing. In the case of heavy clay\\nsoils (black soils), sowing operation is difficult after the receipt of rain. To over come this difficulty,\\nsowing is taken up in dry soil prepared with summer rains, 7-10 days before the anticipated receipt of\\nsowing rains. The seeds germinate after the receipt of the rainfall. This method of sowing is known as\\ndry sowing or pre-monsoon sowing. By this method ,  the entire rainfall received is efficiently utilized.\\n8.6.2 Factors involved in Sowing Management\\nThis can be classified into two broad groups.'),\n",

Mechanical factors - Factors such as depth of sowing, emergence habit, seed size and weight,\\nseedbed texture, seed–soil contact, seedbed fertility, soil moisture etc.\\n(i) Seed size and weight : Heavy and bold seeds produce vigorous seedlings. Application of\\nfertilizer to bold seed tends to encourage the seedlings than the seedlings from small seeds.\\n(ii) Depth of sowing: Optimum depth of sowing ranges from 2.5–3 cm. Depth of sowing depends\\non seed size and availability of soil moisture. Deeper sowing delays field emergence and thus\\ndelays crop duration. Deeper sowing sometimes ensures crop survival under adverse weather\\nand soil conditions mostly in dry lands.\\n(iii) Emergence habit: Hypogeal seedlings may emerge from a relatively deeper layer than epigeal\\nseedlings of similar seed size.\\n(iv) Seedbed texture: Soil texture should minimize crust formation and maximize aeration, which in\\nturn influence the gases, temperature and water content of the soil. V ery fine soil may not\\nmaintain adequate temperature and water holding capacity.\\n(v) Seeds–Soil contact: Seeds require close contact with soil particles to ensur e that water can be\\nabsorbed readily. A tilled soil makes the contact easier. Forming the soil around the seed (broad-\\ncasted seeds) after sowing improves the soil–seed contact.\\n(vi) Seedbed fertility: Tillering crops like rice, ragi, bajra etc., should be sown thinly on fertile soils\\nand more densely on poor soils. Similarly high seed rate is used on poor soil for non-tillering\\ncrops. Although higher the seed rate grater the yield under conditions of low soil fertility, in\\nsome cases such as cotton, a lower seed rate gives better result than a higher seed rate.\\n(vii) Soil moisture: Excess moisture in soil retards ge rmination and induce rotting and damping off\\ndisease except in swamp (deep water) rice. Adjustment in depth is made according to moisture\\nconditions, i.e., deeper sowing on dry soils and shallow sowing on wet soils. Sowing on ridges\\nis usually recommended on poorly drained soils.\\n2. Biological factors -  Factors like companion crops, competition for light, soil microorganisms\\netc.\\n(i) Companion crop: Companion crop is usually sown early  to suppress weed growth and\\ncontrol soil erosion. In cassava + maize/yam cropping, cassava is planted later in yam or\\nmaize to minimize the effect of competition for light. In mixed cropping, all the crops are\\nsown at the same time.\\n(ii) Competition of light: In mixed stands, optimum spacing for each crop minimizes the com-\\npetition of light.\\n(iii) Soil microorganisms: The microorganisms present in the soil should favour seed germina-\\ntion and should not posses any harmful effect on seeds/emerging seedlings.'),\n",

It indicates the size of the area\\navailable for individual plant.\\nCrop geometry is the pattern of distribution of plant over the ground or the shape of the area available\\nto the individual plant, in a crop field.\\n9.1 IMPORTANCE\\nYield of a crop depends on the final plant den sity. The density depends on the germination percentage\\nand the survival rate in the field. Esta blishment of required plant density is essential to get maximum\\nyield. For example when a crop is raised on stored soil moisture under rainfed conditions, high density\\nwill deplete moisture before crop maturity. Where as, low density will leave moisture unutilized. Hence,\\noptimum density will lead to effective utilization of soil moisture, nutrients, sunlight etc. When soil\\nmoisture and nutrients are not limited, higher density is necessary to utilize other growth factors (solar\\nradiation) efficiency. When maximum yield per plant. On the contrary when the density is more,\\nindividual plant gets narrow space leading to competition for growth factors between plants resulting\\nin reduction of yield per plant.\\nYield per plant decreases gradually as plant density per unit area is increased as shown in the. However,\\nthe yield per unit area is increased up to a certain level of plant density due to utilization of growth factors.\\nMaximum yield per unit area can, therefore, be obtained when the plant density is optimum.\\n(a) Plant Density and Yield\\nBiological yield increases with increases in plant density up to a point and reaches a plateau with\\nfurther increase in density, thus no additional biological yield can be obtained. On the other hand, the\\neconomic yield increases with increase in plant density up to a point and subsequently decreases with\\nincreased in density.\\n(b) Plant Density and Growth\\nPlant height increase with increase in plant density due to competition for light. Dense plant stands\\nleads to reduction in leaf thickness and alters leaf orientation. Dry matter production per unit area\\nincrease with increase in plant density up to a limit, as in biological yield.\\n9.2 FACTORS AFFECTING PLANT DENSITY\\nOptimum plant density is necessary to obtain maximum yield.

The factors affecting plant density are grouped into two as ( a) genetic and (b)\\nenvironment factors.\\nA. Genetic Factors (plant or internal factors)\\n(i) Size of plant - The volume occupied by the plant at the time of flowering decides the spacing\\nof the crop. Plants of red gram, cotton, sugarcane etc., occupy larger volume of space in the field\\ncompared to rice, wheat, ragi , etc. Even the varieties of the same crop differ in size of plant.\\n(ii) Elasticity of the plant - V ariation in size or plant between the minimum size of the plant that can\\nproduce some economic yield to the maximum size of the plant that can reach under unlimited\\nspace and resources is the elasticity of the plant. The optimum plant density range is high in\\nindeterminate plants. For example, in indeterminate red gram varieties the optimum plant\\ndensity ranges from 55 to 133 thousand plants/ha. The elasticity of plants is due to branching or\\ntillering. For deter minate plants like maize, sorghum etc., the elasticity is less and hence the\\noptimum plant density range is small. The removal of auxiliary buds is done to get uniform and\\nearly maturity in castor.\\n(iii) Foraging area or soil cover  - The crop should cover the soil as early as possible so as to\\nintercept maximum sunlight. More interception of solar radiation leads to more dry matter\\nproduction. Closely spaced plants intercept more radiation than widely spaced plants. Area of\\nroot spread also decides the density.\\n(iv) Dry matter partitioning  - Dry matter production is related to the amount of solar radiation\\nintercepted by the canopy, which depends on the plant density. As the plant density increases,\\nthe canopy expands more rapidly, more radiation is intercepted and more dry matter is produced.\\nB. Environmental Factors (management factors)\\nThe primary management factor affecting the plant density of any crop varieties is the method of stand\\nestablishment/sowings like transplanting or br oadcasting. For transplanting/direct drilling, the genetic\\nfactors are the deciding factors on the number of plants per unit area. For broadcasting, the factors are:\\n(i) Time of sowing - The crop is subjected to different wea ther conditions when sown at different\\nperiods. Among the weather factors, the most important factors that influence optimum plant\\ndensity are day length and temperature. Photosensitive varieties respond to day length resulting\\nin change in size of the plant. As low temperature retards the growth, higher density is\\nestablished for quicker ground cover.\\n(ii) Rainfall/irrigation - Plant density has to be less under rainfed than irrigated conditions. Under\\nhigher plant densities, more water is lost through tr anspiration. Under adequate irrigation or\\nunder evenly distributed rainf all conditions, higher plant density is r ecommended.\\n(iii) Fertilizer application - Higher plant density is necessary to fully utilize higher level of nutrients\\nin the soil to realize higher yield. Nutrient uptake increases with increase in plant density. Higher\\ndensity under low fertility conditions leads to development of nutrient deficiency symptoms. For\\nexample, rice does not respond to plant density without nitrogen application.\\n(iv) Seed rate - Quantity of seed sown/unit area, viability and establishment rate decides the plant\\ndensity.\\n9.3 CROP GEOMETRY\\nCrop geometry refers to the shape of the space available for individual plants.

Sometimes Agricul-\\nture also defined as a battle with weeds as they strongly compete with crop plants for growth factors.\\n10.1 ORIGIN\\nWeeds are no strangers to man. They have been there ever since he started to cultivate crops about\\n10,000 B.C. and undoubtedly recognized as a problem from the beginning. To him, any plant in the\\nfield other than his crop became weed. Again the characters of certain weed species are very similar to\\nthat of wild plants in the region. Some of the crops for example including the wheat of today are the\\nderivatives of wild grass. Man has further improved them to suit his own taste and fancy. Even today\\nthey are crossed with wild varieties to transfer the desirable characters such as drought and disease\\nresistance. So the weeds are to begin with essential components of native and naturalized flora but in\\ncourse of time these plants are well placed in new environment by the conscious and unconscious\\nefforts of man. Hence, it is considered that many w eeds principally originated from two important and\\nmajor arbitrarily defined groups.\\n\\x7f By man’s conscious effort\\n\\x7f By invasion of plants into man created habitats\\nIn the world, 30,000 species of weeds have been listed. Out of which nearly 18,000 species cause\\nserious damage to agricultural production. Eighteen weeds are considered as the most serious in the\\nworld and about twenty six species have been listed as principal weeds in crop fields of India, and are\\nlisted in annexure V . Weeds compete with crops for water, soil nutrients, light and space (i.e., CO2) and\\nthus reduce crop yields.\\n10.2 CHARACTERISTICS\\nWeeds are highly competitive and are highly adaptable under varied adverse situations. Reproductive\\nmechanism is far superior to crop plants particularly under unf avourable side; therefore, weeds are\\nconstantly invading the field and try to succeed ov er less adapted crop plants.

Factors Favouring Weed Growth\\nIn modern agriculture, the crops grown are widely spaced, increasingly manured and irrigated, very\\nslow growth of crops in initial stages (cotton, sorghum, castor, etc.) and are usually grown in pure stand.\\nThus, these factors favour for the easy and quick establishment of weeds in crop fields.\\nB.

Losses\\n1.

Loss in crop quality - If a crop contains weed seeds it is to be rejected, especially when the crop\\nis grown for seed. For example, the wild oat weed seeds are similar in size and shape of the crops\\nlike barley, wheat, and its admixture may lead to rejection for seed purpose. Contamination by\\npoisonous weed seeds is unacceptable and increases costs of crop cleaning. The leafy vegetables\\nmuch suffer due to weed problem as the leafy weed mixture spoil the economic value.\\n3. Weeds as reservoirs of pests and diseases - Weeds form a part of community of organisms in\\na given area. Consequently, they are food sources for some animals, and are themselves suscep-\\ntible to many pests and diseases. However, because of their close association with crop they may\\nserve as important reservoir s or alternate host of pests and diseases.\\n4. Interference in crop handling - Some weeds can make the operation of agricultural machinery\\nmore difficult, more costly and even impossible. Heavy infestation of Cynodon dactylon causes\\npoor ploughing performance.\\n5. Reduction in land value - Heavy infestation by perennial weeds could make the land unsuitable\\nor less suitable for cultivation resulting in loss in its monetary value. Thousands of hectare of\\ncultivable area in rice growing regions of India have been abandoned or not being regularly\\ncultivated due to severe infestation of nut grass (Cyperus rotundus) and other perennial grasses.\\n6. Limitation of crop choice - When certain weeds are heavily infested, it will limit the growth of\\na particular crop. The high infestation of parasitic weeds such as Striga lutea may limit the\\ncultivation of sorghum or sugarcane.\\n7. Loss of human efficiency - Weeds reduce human efficiency through physical discomfort caused\\nby allergies and poisoning. Weeds such as congress weed ( Parthenium hysterophorus) cause\\nitching. Thorny weeds like Solanum sp. restrict movement of farm workers in carrying out farm\\npractices such as fertilizer application, insect and disease control measures, irrigation, harvest-\\ning, etc.\\n8. Problems due to aquatic weeds - Aquatic weeds that grow along the irrigation canals, channels\\nand water streams restrict the flow of water. Weed obstruction causes reduction in velocity of\\nflow and increases stagnation of water and may lead to high siltation and reduced carrying\\ncapacity. Aquatic weeds form breeding grounds for obnoxious insects like mosquitoes. They\\nreduce recreational value by interfering with fishing, swimming, boating, hunting and naviga-\\ntion on streams and canals.\\n9. Other problems - Weeds are troublesome not only in cr op plants but also in play grounds and\\nroad sides etc. Alternanthera echinata and Tribulus terresstris occur in many of the playgrounds\\ncausing annoyance to players and spectators.\\nD.  Beneficial Effects\\nWeeds are indirectly responsible for crop cultivation, but for them cultivated crops may not receive\\nmuch attention\\nWeeds as fodder - Useful as good fodder for milch animals. Most weeds are preferred by cattle and\\nweeds like Rynchosia aurea, R. capitata and Clitoria terneata are very good fodder legumes and also\\nHariyali and filed bind weed ( Convolvulus arvensis).\\nWeeds as vegetables - Used as green vegetables and weeds serve as human food e.g., Amaranthus\\nviridis and Digera arvensis used as greens.\\nWeed as soil binder\\ns - Panicum repense is an excellent soil binder; keeps bunds in position and\\nprevents soil erosion in high rainfall regions and hill y slopes.

Under world conditions about 30,000 species is grouped as weeds. Weeds\\nmay be classified in the following ways.\\n10.3.1 Based on Morphology\\nBased on the morphology of the plant, the weeds ar e also classified into three categories. This is the\\nmost widely used classification by the weed scientists.\\n(a) Grasses - All the weeds come under the family Poaceae are called as grasses which are charac-\\nteristically having long narrow spin y leaves. The examples are Echinocloa colonum, Cynodon\\ndactylon.'),\n",

The leaves are\\nmostly from the base having modified stem with or without tubers. The examples are Cyperus\\nrotundus, Fimbrystylis miliaceae.\\n(c) Broad leaved weeds - This is the major group of weeds as all other family weeds come under\\nthis except that is discussed earlier. All dicotyl edon weeds are broad lea ved weeds. The exam-\\nples are Flavaria australacica, Digera arvensis, Abutilon indicum.\\n10.3.2 Based on Life Span of Weeds\\nBased on life span (Ontogeny), weeds are classified as Annual weeds, Biennial weeds and Perennial\\nweeds.\\n(a) Annual Weeds - Those that live only for a season or year and complete their life cycle in that\\nseason or year is called annual. These are small herbs with shallow roots and weak stem.\\nProduces seeds in profusion and the mode of propagation is commonly through seeds. After\\nseeding the annuals die away and the seeds germinate and start the next generation in the next\\nseason or year following. Most common f ield weeds are annuals. The examples are:\\n(a) Monsoon annual - Commelina benghalensis, Boerhaavia erecta\\n(b) Winter annual -  Chenopodium album\\n(b) Biennials - It completes the vegetative growth in the first season, flower and set seeds in the\\nsucceeding season and then dies. These are found mainly in non-cropped areas. e.g., Alternanthera\\nechinata, Daucus carota\\n(c) Perennials - Perennials live for more  than two years an d may live almost indefinitely. They\\nadapted to withstand adverse conditions. They pr opagate not only through seeds but also by\\nunderground stem, root, rhizomes, tubers etc. And hence they are further classified into\\nSimple perennials: Plants propagated only by seeds. E.g., Sonchus arvensis.\\nBulbous perennials:  Plants, which possess a modified stem with scales and reproduce\\nmainly from bulbs and seeds. e.g., Allium sp.\\nCorm perennials:  Plants that possess a modified shoot and fleshy stem and reproduce\\nthrough corm and seeds. e.g., Timothy sp.\\nCreeping perennials: Reproduced through seeds as well as with one of the following.\\nRhizome: Plants having underground stem– Sorghum halapense\\nStolen: Plants having horizontal creeping stem above the ground–Cynodon dactylon\\nRoots: Plants having enlarged root system w ith numerous buds–Convolvulus arvensis\\nTubers: Plants ha ving modified rhizomes ada pted for storage of food–Cyper us rotundus\\n10.3.3 Based on Ecological Affinities\\n(a) Wetland weeds - They are tender annuals with semi-aquatic habit. They can thrive as well under\\nwaterlogged and in partially dry condition. Propagation is chiefly by seed. e.g., Ammania baccifera,\\nEclipta alba.\\n(b) Garden land weeds - These weeds neither require large quantities of water like wetland weeds\\nnor can they successfully withstand extreme drought as dry land weeds. e.g., Trianthema\\nportulacastrum, Digera arvensis.\\n(c) Dry land weeds - These are usually hardy plants with dee p root system. They are adapted to\\nwithstand drought on account of mucilaginous nature of the stem and hairiness. E.g., Tribulus\\nterrestris, Convolvulus arvensis.'),\n",

Had there been no way of natural dispersal of weeds, we would not have\\nhad them today in such widely spread and vigorous forms. In the absence of proper means of their\\ndispersal, weeds could not have moved from one country to another. “Weeds are good travelers”. An\\neffective dispersal of weed seeds and fruits requires two essentials viz., a successful dispersing agent\\nand an effective adaptation to the new environment. Common weed dispersal agents are: ( a) wind,\\n(b) water, (c) animals and ( d) human.\\n(a) Wind - Weed seeds and fruits that disseminate through wind possess special organs to keep them\\nafloat. Such organs are:\\nPappus - It is a parachute like modification of persistent calyx into hairs. e.g., Asteraceae\\nfamily weeds. e.g., Tridax procumbens.\\nComose - Some weed seeds are cove red with hairs, partially or fully e.g., Calotropis sp.\\nFeathery, persistent styles - Styles are persistent and feathery. e.g., Anemone sp.\\nBaloon - Modified papery calyx that encloses the fruits loosely along with  entrapped air.\\ne.g., Physalis minima.\\nWings - One or more appendages that act as wings. e.g., Acer macrophyllum.\\n(b) Water - Aquatic weeds disperse largely through water. They may drift either as whole plants,\\nplant fragments or as seeds with the water currents. Terrestrial weed seeds also disperse through\\nirrigation and drainage water.\\n(c) Animals - Birds and animals eat many weed fruits. The ingested weed seeds are passed in viable\\nform with animal excreta (0.2% in chicks, 9.6% in calves, 8.7% in horses and 6.4% in sheep),\\nwhich is dropped wherever the animal moves. This mechanism of weed dispersal in called\\nendozoochory e.g., Lantana seeds by birds. Loranthus seeds stick on beaks of birds. Farm\\nanimals carry weed seeds and fruits on their skin, hair and hooves. This is aided by special\\nappendages such as Hooks (Xanthium strumarium), Stiff hairs ( Cenchrus sp.), Sharp spines\\n(Tribulus terrestris) and Scarious bracts ( Achyranthus aspera). Even ants carry a huge number\\nof weed seeds. Donkeys eat  Prosophis julifera pods.\\n(d) Man - Man disperses n umerous weed seeds and fruits with raw agricultural produce. Weeds\\nmature at the same time and height along with crop, due to their similar size and shape as that\\nof crop seed man unknowingly harvest the weeds also, and aids in dispersal of weed seeds. Such\\nweeds are called “Satellite weeds” e.g. Avena fatua, Phalaris minor.\\n(e) Manure and silage - Viable weed seeds are present in the dung of farm animals, which forms part\\nof the FYM. Besides, addition of mature weeds to compost pit as farm waste also act as source.\\n(f) Dispersal by machinery - Machinery used for cultivation purposes like tractors can easily\\ncarries weed seeds, rhizomes and stolons when worked on infested fields and latter dropping\\nthem in other fields to star t new infestation.\\n(g) Intercontinental movement of weeds -  Introduction of weeds from one continent to another\\nthrough 1. Crop seed, 2. Feed stock, 3. Packing material and 4.

Survival Mechanism\\nThe seed is the primary means of survival mechanism of annual weeds while the vegetative parts such\\nas buds, rhizomes tubers and bulbs offer on additional mechanism for perennial weeds.\\n(a) Sexual reproduction - Through sexual reproduction abundant and small seeds are produced.\\nAnnual and biennial weeds depend on seed production, as the sole means of propagation and\\nsurvival of perennial weeds are less dependent on this mechanism.

Seed Dormancy as Survival Mechanism\\nWeed seeds possess a variety of special ger mination mechanisms adapted to changes in temperature,\\nmoisture, aeration, exposure to light, depth of burial of seeds etc. When conditions are unfavourable for\\ngermination, they can remain dormant or delay ger mination. Conditions favourable for weeds seed\\ngermination are:\\n\\x7f Seeds of many weeds require an exposure to light f or germination. This is regulated by bluish-\\ngreen protein pigment called phytochrome.\\n\\x7f Many weed seeds germina te under aerobic conditions while some require anaerobic condition.\\nSoil turnover during ploughing and other operations exposes the seeds to light and induces\\ngermination.\\n\\x7f Periodicity of germina tion is another specialized germination mechanism.

Seed Dormancy\\nDormancy is a state of seeds and buds in which they are alive but not germinated. If all weed seeds were\\nto germinate at one time,  their seedlings could be destroyed. Dormancy allows storage of millions of\\nweed seeds in soil and enables them to grow in flushes over years. In this context, the old gardeners\\nsaying “One year Seeding seven years Weeding ” is very appropriate. In fact, weed seeds have been\\nfound viable even after 20-80 years of burial in soil.\\nWeed seeds exhibit three types of dormancy.\\n1. Enforced dormancy - It is due to deep placement of weed seeds in soil during ploughing of the\\nfield. Weed seeds germinate readily when they are restored to top 3-5 cm. Enforced Dormancy\\nis a non-specific character of seed. Cultivation encounter s enforced dormancy by bringing the\\nweeds to surface where they are exposed to light besides better aeration. High soil temperature\\nand NO3 content of surface soil may further help in breaking seed dormancy.\\n2. Innate dormancy - It is a genetically controlled character and it is a feature of specific weed\\nseeds, which fail to germinate even if they are present in the top 3–5 cm soil, and adequate soil\\nmoisture and temperature provided to them. The possible reasons are the presence of ( i) hard\\nseed coats e.g., Setaria, Ipomoea, Xanthium spp. and (ii) immature embryos e.g., Polygonum. In\\ncertain weed seeds particularly of Xerophytic origin, presence of inhibitors is responsible for\\ninnate dormancy. It can be overcome w ith passage of time, or under the influence of some\\nclimatic pressure.\\n3. Induced dormancy - Induced dormancy results from some sudden physiological change in\\nnormally non-dormant weed seeds under the impact of marked rise in temperature and or CO 2\\ncontent of soil, low O 2 pressure, water logging etc.  Wild oat (Avena fatua) seeds exhibit all three\\nkinds of dormancy.\\nD.  Persistence of Weeds (adaptation)\\nPersistence is an adaptive potential of a weed that enables it to grow in any environment. In an agricul-\\ntural situation, the cropping system with its (associated habitat) management practices, determines the\\npersistence of weed species. It is largely influenced by climatic, edaphic (soil) and biotic factors, which\\naffect its occurrence, abundance, range and distribution.\\nFactors affecting persistence\\n1. Climatic factors - Climate can effect variations in cuticle development, pubescence, vegetative\\ngrowth, vigour, competitiveness etc. Climate thus has a profound effect on the persistence of\\nweeds, which can adapt to a wide variety of climates. The important climatic factors are light,\\ntemperature, rainfall, wind and humidity.\\nLight - Light intensity, quality and duration are important in influencing the germination,\\ngrowth, reproduction and distribution of weeds. Photoperiod governs flowering time, seed\\nsetting and maturation and on the evolution of various ecotypes within a weed species.\\nTolerance to shading is a major adapta tion that enables weeds to persist.\\nTemperature - Temperature of atmosphere and soil affects the latitudinal and longitudinal\\ndistribution of weeds. Soil temperature affects seed germination and dormancy, which is a\\nmajor survival mechanism of weeds.'),\n",

More rain-\\nfall or less rainfall determines reproduction and survival.\\nWind - Wind is a principal factor in the dissemination of weeds.\\n2. Soil factors - Soil factors are soil water, aeration, temperature, pH and fertility level and\\ncropping system. Some weed species are char acteristically alkali plants, known as basophilic\\n(pH 8.5) which can grow well in alkali soils and those grow in acidic soil is known as Acidophiles.\\nBasophilesAcidophiles Neutophiles\\nAlkaligrass – Puccinalia spp. Cynodon dactylon Common weed\\nQuack grass – Agrophyron repens Digitaria sanguinalis\\nSeveral weed species of compositae family grow well in saline soils. A shift in soil pH, towards\\nacid side due to continuous use of Ammonium sulphate as a ‘N’ source could cause a shift in the\\nweed spectrum. Many weeds can grow well in soils of low fertility level however, can adapt well\\nto soils of high fertility also. Weeds also has adapta tion to moist soil, drought condition etc.\\n3. Biotic factors - In a cropping situation, the major effects on weeds are those exerted by the crop\\nas it competes for available resources. Once, a particular weed species is introduced, its\\npersistence is determined by the degree of competition offered by the crop and also the\\nagricultural practices associated with the growing of a crop may encourage or discourage spe-\\ncific weeds.\\nE.g., Ponding of water – Cynodon dies\\nRepeated cultivation – discourage nut sedge.\\nCrops that serve as hosts to parasitic weeds, (Sorghum – Striga) crop-induced stimulants are\\nexamples of other biotic factors.\\n10.6 CROP-WEED INTERACTIONS\\nCompetition and allelopathy are the main interactions, which are of importance between crop and\\nweed. Allelopathy is distinguished from competition because it depends on a chemical compound being\\nadded to the environment while competition involves removal or reduction of an essential factor or\\nfactors from the environment, which would have been otherwise utilized.\\nI.  Crop Weed Competition\\nWeeds appear much more adapted to agro-ecosystems than our crop plants. Without interference by\\nman, weeds would easily wipe out the crop plants. This is because of their competition for nutrients,\\nmoisture, light and space, which are the principle factors of production of crop. Generally, an increase\\nin on kilogram of weed growth will decrease one kilogram of crop growth.\\n1. Competition for nutrients  - Weeds usually absorb mineral nutrients faster than many crop\\nplants and accumulate them in their tissues in relatively larger amounts.\\n\\x7f Amaranthus  sp. accumulate over 3% N on dry weight basis and are termed as “nitrophills”.\\n\\x7f Achyranthus aspera , a ‘P’ accumulator with over 1.5% P2O5.\\n\\x7f Chenopodium  sp. and Portulaca sp. are ‘K’ lovers with over 1.3% K2O in dry matter.'),\n",

Wheat 1.33 0.59 1.44\\nThe associated weed is responsive to nitrogen and it utilizes more of the applied ‘N’ than the\\ncrop. e.g., the ‘N’ uptake by Echinochloa crusgalli is more than rice. Nutrient removal by weeds\\nleads to huge loss of nutrients in each crop season,  which is often twice that of crop plants. For\\ninstance at early stages of maize cultivation, the weeds found to remove 9 times more of N, 10\\ntimes more of P and 7 times more of K.\\n2. Competition for moisture - In general, for producing equal amounts of dry matter, weeds\\ntranspire more water than do most of our crop plants. It becomes increasingly critical with\\nincreasing soil moisture stress, as found in arid and semi-arid areas. As a rule, C4 plants utilize\\nwater more efficiently resulting in more biomass per unit of water. Cynodon dactylon had almost\\ntwice as high transpiration rate as pearl millet. In weedy fields soil moisture may be exhausted\\nby the time the crop reaches the fruiting stage, i.e., the peak consumptive use period of the crop,\\ncausing significant loss in crop yields.\\n3. Competition for light - It may commence very early in the cop season if a dense weed growth\\nsmothers the crop seedlings. It becomes important element of crop-weed competition when\\nmoisture and nutrients are plentiful. In dry land agriculture in years of normal rainfall the crop-\\nweed competition is limited to nitrogen and light. Unlike competition for nutrients and moisture\\nonce weeds shade a crop plant, increased light intensity cannot benefit it.\\n4. Competition for space (CO 2) - Crop-weed competition for space is the requirement for CO 2\\nand the competition may occur under extremely crowded plant community condition. A more\\nefficient utilization of CO2 by C4 type weeds may contribute to their rapid growth over C 3 type\\nof crops.\\nA.  Weed Competition on Crop Growth and Yield\\nCrop growth and yield is affected. Crop suffers from nutritional deficiency. Leaf area development is\\nreduced. Yield attributes will be lowered. It reduces the water use by the crop and affects the dry matter\\nproduction. It lowers the input response and causes yield reduction.

Factors affecting the Competitive Ability of Crops Against Weeds\\n(a) Density of weeds -  Increase in density of weed decrease in yield is a normal phenomena.\\nHowever, it is not linear as few weeds do not affect the yields so much as other weed does and\\nhence, it is a sigmoidal relationship.'),\n",

Crop density and rectangularity are very important in determining\\nthe quantum and quality of crop environment available for the growth of weeds. Wide row\\nspacing with simultaneous high, intra-row crop plant population may induce dense weed growth.\\nIn this respect, square planting of crops in which there are equal row and plant spacing should\\nbe ideal in reducing intra-crop plant competition.\\n(c) Type of weeds species - The type of weeds that occur in a particular crop influences the com-\\npetition. Occurrence of a particular species of weed greatly influences the competition between\\nthe crop and weed. For e.g., E. crusgalli  in rice, Setaia viridis in corn and Xanthium sp. in\\nsoybean affects the crop yield. Flavaria australasica offers more competition than the grasses.\\n(d) Type of crop species and their varieties - Crops and their varieties differ in their competing\\nability with weeds e.g., the decreasing order of weed competing ability is as: barley, rye, wheat\\nand oat. High tolerance of barley to competition from weeds is assigned to its ability to develop\\nmore roots that are extensive during initia l three weeks growth period than the others. Fast\\ncanopy forming and tall crops suffer less from weed competition than the slow growing and\\nshort stature and crops. Dwarf and semi-dwarf varieties of crops are usually more susceptible to\\ncompetition from weeds than the tall varieties became they grow slowly and initial stage. In\\naddition, their short stature covers the weeds less effectively. When we compare the crop-weed\\ncompetition between two varieties of groundnut TMV 2 (Bunch) and TMV 3 (Spreading). TMV\\n2 incurred a loss of over 30% pod yiel d under uncontrolled weed-crop competition while TMV\\n3 lost only about 15% in its yield. The main reason is due to the spreading nature of TMV 3,\\nwhich smothered weeds. Longer duration cultivars of rice have been found more competitive to\\nweeds than the short duration ones.\\n(e) Soil factor - Soil type, soil fertility, soil moisture and soil reaction influences the crop weed\\ncompetition. Elevated soil fertility usually stimulates weeds more than the crop, reducing thus\\ncrop yields. Fertilizer application of weedy crop could increase crop yields to a much lower level\\nthan the yield increase obtained when a weed free crop is applied with fertilizer. Weeds are\\nadapted to grow well and compete with crops, in both moisture stress and ample moisture\\nconditions. Removal of an intense moisture stress ma y thus benefit crops more than the weeds\\nleading to increased yields. If the weeds we re already present at the time of irrigation, they\\nwould grow so luxuriantly as to completely over power the crops. If the crop in irrigated after\\nit has grown 15 cm or more in a weed free environment irrigation could hasten closing in of crop\\nrows, thus suppressing weeds. Abnormal soil reactions often aggravate weed competition. It is\\ntherefore specific weed species suited to different soil reactions exist with us, our crops grow\\nbest only in a specified range of soil pH. Weeds would offer more intense competition to crops\\non normal pH soils than on normal pH soils.\\n(f) Climate - Adverse weather condition, e.g., drought, excessive rains,  extremes of temperature,\\nwill favour weeds since most of our crop plants are susceptible to climatic stresses. It is further\\nintensified when crop cultivation is stratified over marginal lands. All such stresses weaken\\ncrops inherent capacity to fight weeds.\\n(g) Time of germination  - In general, when the time of g ermination of crop coincides with the\\nemergence of first flush of weeds, it leads to intense Crop-Weed interference.  Sugarcane takes\\nabout one month to complete  its germination phase while weeds require very less time to\\ncomplete its germination. Weed seeds germinate most readily from 1.25 cm of soil. Few weeds\\neven from 15 cm depth. Therefore, planting method that dries the top 3 to 5 cm of soil rapidly'),\n",

Critical period of Weed Competition\\nCritical period of weed competition is defined as the shortest time span during the crop growth when\\nweeding results in highest Economic returns. The critical period of crop-weed competition is the period\\nfrom the time of sowing up to, which the crop is to be maintained in a weed free environment to get the\\nhighest economical yield. The weed competition in crop field is invariably severe in early stages of crop\\nthan at later stages. Generally in a crop of 100 days duration, the first 35 days after sowing should be\\nmaintained in a weed free condition (Table 10.4). There is no need to attempt for a weed free condition\\nthroughout the life period of the crop, as it will entail unnecessary additional expenditure without\\nproportionate increase in yield.\\nTable 10.4.

Preventive Method\\nThe appearance of weeds in the cropped areas can be prevented by adopting the following measures for\\nadoption wherever possible and practicable. It encompasses all measures taken to prevent the introduc-\\ntion and/or establishment and spread of weeds. Such areas may be local, regional or national in size.

Sterilize\\nthe spot with suitable chemical.\\n\\x7f Quarantine re gulations are available in almost all countries to deny the entry of weed seeds and\\nother propagules into a country thr ough airports and shipyards.\\nB. Curative Methods\\nThese methods include eradication and control of weeds in the field.\\n1. Eradication Measures - It is an ideal weed control method rarely achieved. It infers that a given\\nweed species, its seed and vegetative part has been killed or completely removed from a given\\narea and that weed will not reappear unless reintroduced to the area. Because of its difficulty and\\nhigh cost, eradication is usually attempted only in smaller areas such as few ha., a few thousand\\nm2 or less. Eradication is often used in high value areas such as green houses, ornamental plant\\nbeds and containers. This may be desirable and economical when the weed species is extremely\\nnoxious and persistent as to make cropping difficult and economical. Weeds are destroyed\\nimmediately before its multiplication, dispersion and acclimatization as and when a new weed\\nspecies is found. It can be done by,\\n\\x7f destroying the species at the initial stage of introduction and before it produces any propagule\\n(at an early growth stage), and\\n\\x7f degenerating the buried dormant viable seeds by fumigation, flooding, heating and other\\nmethods.\\n2. Control Measures - In these method weeds are not eradicated but their growth is checked and\\nthe number of weeds (weed intensity) is minimized so that they do not affect crop yield or it\\nencompasses those processes where by weed infestations are reduced but not necessarily elimi-\\nnated. It is a matter of degree ranging from poor to excellent. In control methods, the weeds are\\nseldom killed but their growth is severely restricted, the crop makes a normal yield. In general,\\nthe degree of weed control obtained is dependent on the characters of weeds involved and the\\neffectiveness of the control method used.\\nMethods of weed control - Weed control aims at only putting down the weeds present by some\\nkind of physical or chemical means while weed management is a system approach whereby\\nwhole land use planning is done in advance to minimize the very invasion of weeds in aggressive\\nforms and give crop plants a strongly competitive advantage over the weeds. Weed control\\nmethods are grouped into cultural, physical, chemical and biological. Every method of weed\\ncontrol has its own advantages and disadvantages. No single method is successful under all\\nweed situations. Many a time, a combination of these methods gives effective and economic\\ncontrol than a single method.\\n(a) Mechanical methods - This method aims to destroy weeds by cutting and removing or by\\ndesiccation and exhaustion of weeds by adopting several methods like hand hoeing, hand\\npulling, tillage, flooding, burning, mulching by non-living materials etc. However the choice\\nof a method depends on location, e xtent and habitat of weeds.'),\n",

Tillage - Tillage removes weeds from the soil resulting in their death. It may weaken plants\\nthrough injury of root and stem pruning, reducing their competitiveness or regenerative\\ncapacity. Tillage also buries weeds. Tillage operation includes ploughing, disking, harrowing\\nand leveling which is used to promote the ger mination of weeds through soil turnover and\\nexposure of seeds to sunlight, which can be destroyed effectively later. In case of perennials,\\nboth top and underground growth is injured and destroyed by tillage.\\n2. Hoeing - Hoe has been the most appropriate and widely used weeding tool for centuries. It\\nis however, still a very useful implement to obtain results effectively and cheaply. It supple-\\nments the cultivator in row crops. Hoeing is particularly more effective on annuals and\\nbiennials as weed growth can be completely destr oyed. In case of perennials, it destroyed\\nthe top growth with little effect on underground plant parts resulting in re-growth.\\n3. Hand pulling/ hand weeding - It is done by physical removal or pulling out of weeds by\\nhand or removal by implements called khurpi, w hich resembles sickle. It is probably the\\noldest method of controlling weeds and it is still a practical and efficient method of\\neliminating weeds in cropped and non-cropped lands. It is very effective against annuals,\\nbiennials and controls only upper portions of perennials. Hand pulling/hoeing is effective\\nonly when the weed infested area is small. Repeated hoeing and tillage is essential to control\\nnut grass.\\n4. Digging - Digging is very useful in the case of perennial weeds to remove the underground\\npropagating parts of weeds from the deeper layer of the soil.\\n5. Chiseling- It is done by hand using a chisel hoe, similar to a spade with a long handle. It\\ncuts and shapes the above ground weed growth.\\n6. Sickling and mowing - Sickling is also done by hand with the help of sickle to remove the\\ntop growth of weeds to prevent seed pr oduction and to starve the underground parts. It is\\npopular in sloppy areas where only the tall weed growth is sickled leaving the root system\\nto hold the soil in place to prevent soil erosion.

Flooding - Flooding is successful against weed species sensitive to longer periods of sub-\\nmergence in water. Flooding kills plants by reducing oxygen availability for plant growth.\\nThe success of flooding depends upon complete submergence of weeds for longer periods.\\nFlooding is done in rice fields to remove the regenerative parts of sedges.\\n9.

These practices if u sed properly, help in controlling weeds. Cultural\\nmethods, alone cannot control weeds, but help in reducing weed population. They should, there-\\nfore, be used in combination with other methods. In cultural methods, tillage, fertilizer applica-\\ntion, and irrigation are important. In addition, aspects like selection of variety, time of sowing,\\ncropping system, cleanliness of the farm etc., is also useful in controlling weeds.\\n1. Field preparation - The field has to be kept weed free. Flowering of weeds should not be\\nallowed. This helps in prevention of build up of weed seed population.\\n2. Summer tillage - The practice of summer tillage or off-season tillage is one of the effective\\ncultural methods to check the growth of perennial weed population in crop cultivation.\\nInitial tillage before cropping should encourage clod formation. These clods, which have\\nthe weed propagules, upon drying desiccate the same. Subsequent tillage operations should\\nbreak the clods into small units to further expose the shriveled weeds to the hot sun.\\n3. Optimum plant population - Lack of adequate plant popula tion is prone to heavy weed\\ninfestation, which becomes, dif ficult to control later. Therefore, practices like selection of\\nproper seed, right method of sowing, adequate seed rate protection of seed from soil borne\\npests and diseases etc., are very important to obtain pr oper and uniform crop stand capable\\nof offering competition to the weeds.\\n4. Crop rotation - The possibilities of a certain weed species or group of species occurring is\\ngreater if the same crop is grown year after year. In many instances, crop rotation can\\neliminate at least reduce difficult weed problems. The obnoxious weeds like Cyperus rotundus\\ncan be controlled effectively by including low land rice in crop rotation. Inclusion of\\nsmothering crop or competitive crops like sunflower, sorghum, sweet, potato, fodder grasses\\nin rotation will effectively control the weeds. The selected crops should grow thickly and\\ndevelop dense canopy and shade to suppress the weeds.\\nCompetitive plants- Parthenium hysterophorus can be effectively controlled by growing\\nCassia sericea Parthenium through allelopathic effect. Brachiaria mutica (Para grass) is\\nhighly competitive to the growth of Typha sp. in ditches.\\n5. Growing of intercrops - Inter cropping suppresses weeds better than sole cropping and\\nthus provides an opportunity to utilize crops themselves as tools of weed management.\\nMany short duration pulses viz., green gram and soybean effectively smother weeds without\\ncausing reduction in the yield of main crop.\\n6. Mulching - Mulch is a protective covering of material maintained on soil surface. Mulching\\nhas smothering effect on weed control by excluding light from the photosynthetic portions\\nof a plant and thus inhibiting the top growth. It is very effective against annual weeds and\\nsome perennial weeds like Cynodon dactylon. Mulching is done by dry or green crop'),\n",

To be effective the mulch should be thick enough\\nto prevent light transmission and eliminate photosynthesis.\\n7. Solarisation - This is another method of utilization of solar energy for the desiccation of\\nweeds. In this method, the soil temperature is further raised by 5–10ºC by covering a pre-\\nsoaked fallow field with thin transparent plastic sheet. The plastic sheet checks the long wave\\nback radiation from the soil and prevents loss of energy by hindering moisture evaporation.\\n8. Stale seedbed - A stale seedbed is one where initial one or two flushes of weeds are\\ndestroyed before planting of a crop. This is achieved by soaking a well-prepared field with\\neither irrigation or rain and allowing the weeds to ge rminate. At this stage a shallow tillage\\nor non-residual herbicide like paraquat may be used to destroy the dense flush of young\\nweed seedlings. This may be follo wed immediately by sowing . This technique allows the\\ncrop to germinate in almost weed-free environment.\\n9. Blind tillage - The tillage of the soil after sowing a cr op before the crop plants emerge is\\nknown as blind tillage. It is extensively employed to minimize weed intensity in drill sowing\\ncrops where emergence of crop seedling is hindered by soil crust formed on receipt of rain\\nor irrigation immediately after sowing.\\n10. Crop management practices - Good crop management practices that play an important\\nrole in weed control are:\\n\\x7f Vigorous and fast growing crop varieties are better competitors with weeds.\\n\\x7f Proper placement of fertilizers ensures greater availability of nutrients to crop plants,\\nthus keeping the weeds at a disadvantage.\\n\\x7f Better irrigation practices to have a good head start over the weeds.\\n\\x7f Proper crop rotation programme.\\n\\x7f Higher plant population per unit area results in smothering effect on weed growth.\\nMerits\\n\\x7f Low cost for weed control\\n\\x7f Easy to adopt\\n\\x7f No residual problem\\n\\x7f Technical skill is not involved\\n\\x7f No damage to crops\\n\\x7f Effective weed control\\n\\x7f Crop-weed ecosystem is maintained\\nDemerits\\n\\x7f Immediate and quick weed control is not possible\\n\\x7f Weeds are kept under suppressed condition\\n\\x7f Perennial and problematic weeds can not be controlled\\n\\x7f Practical difficulty in adoption\\n(c) Biological methods - Bio control is defined as the use of living organisms to suppress a pest\\npopulation, making it less abundant and thus less dama ging than that it would otherwise be or\\nUse of living organisms i.e., bioagents viz., insects, disease organisms, herbivorous fish, snails\\nor even competitive plants for the control of weeds is called biological control.

Bioherbicides having patho-\\ngenic organisms like fungi, bacteria and virus are used as biocontrol agents. They are applied as\\nchemicals. These are native pathogen, cultured artificially and sprayed just like post-emergence herbi-\\ncides each season on target weed, particularly in crop areas. Fungal pathogens of weed have been used\\nto a larger extent than bacterial, viral or nematode pathogens, because, bacteria and virus are unable to\\nactively penetrate the host and require natural opening or vectors to initiate disease in plants. Here the\\nspecific fungal spores or their fermentation product is sprayed against the target weed. Some registered\\nmycoherbicides in western countries are given in Table 10.5.\\n(d) Chemical methods - Chemicals, which can kill the weeds or control weed growth are known as\\nherbicides. Using herbicides for the control of weeds is called chemical weed control.\\nTable 10.5. Registered Mycoherbicides\\nNo. Product Content Target weed\\n1.

Principle\\nThe selectivity exhibited by certain chemicals to cultivated crops in controlling its associated weeds\\nwithout affecting the crops forms basis for the chemical weed control. Such  selectivity may be due to\\ndifferences in the morphology, differential absor ption, differential translocation, differential deactiva-\\ntion etc.\\nii. Merits\\nHerbicides can be recommended for ad verse soil and climatic conditions, as manual weeding is\\nhighly impossible during monsoon season. Herbicides can control weeds even before they emerge from\\nthe soil so that crops can ge rminate and grow in completely weed-free environment at early stages. It\\nis usually not possible with physical weed comfort. Weeds, which resemble like crop in vegetative\\nphase may escape in manual weeding. However, these weeds are controlled by herbicides. Herbicide is\\nhighly suitable for broadcasted and closely spaced crops. Herbicides controls the weeds without any\\ninjury to the root system of the associated standing crop especially in plantation  crops like Tea and\\nCoffee. It reduces the need for pre planting tillage and controls many perennial weed species, which\\ncannot be controlled by other methods. Herbicides control the weed in the field itself or insitu control-\\nling where as mechanical method may lead to dispersal of weed species through seed. It is profitable\\nwhere labour is scarce and expensive. Herbicide application is well suited for minimum tillage concept\\nand it provides early season/zero day weed control and its application is highly economical.'),\n",

Based on target site\\nDepending on the target site, the herbicides are classified into soil applied herbicides and foliage\\napplied or foliar herbicides.\\nSoil application Foliar application\\n(a) Surface ( i) Blanket spray\\n(b) Sub surface (ii) Directed spray\\n(c) Band ( iii) Protected spray\\n(d) Fumigation (iv) Spot treatment\\n(e) Herbigation\\nSoil application\\n(a) Surface application - Soil active herbicides are applied uniformly on the surface of the soil\\neither by spraying or by broadcasting. The applied herbicides are either left undisturbed or\\nincorporated into the soil. Incorporation is done to prevent the volatilization and photo-decom-\\nposition of the herbicides. e.g., Fluchoralin–Left undisturbed under irrigated condition and in-\\ncorporated under rainfed condition.\\n(b) Subsurface application  - It is the application of herbicides in a concentrated band, about\\n7–10 cm below the soil surface for controlling perennial weeds. For this special type of nozzle\\nis introduced below the soil under the cover of a sweep hood. e.g., Carbamate herbicides to\\ncontrol Cyperus rotundus and Nitralin herbicides to control Convolvulus arvensis.\\n(c) Band application -  Application to a restricted band along the crop rows leaving an untreated\\nband in the inter-rows. Later inter-rows are cultivated to remove the weeds. Saving in cost is\\npossible here. For example when a 30 cm wide band of a herbicide applied over a crop rows that\\nwere spaced 90 cm apart, then two-third cost is saved.\\n(d) Fumigation - Application of volatile chemicals into confined spaces or into the soil to produce\\ngas that will destroy weed seeds is called fumigation. Herbicides used for fumigation are called\\nas fumigants. These are good for killing perennial weeds and as well for eliminating weed seeds.\\nE.g., Methyl bromide, Metham, etc.\\n(e) Herbigation -  Application of herbicides with irrigation water both by surface and sprinkler\\nsystems. In India farmers apply fluchloralin for chillies and tomato, while in western countries\\napplication of EPTC with sprinkler irrigation water is very common in Lucerne.\\n1.  Foliar application\\n(i) Blanket spray - Uniform application of herbicides to standing crops without considering the\\nlocation of the crop. Only highly selective herbicides are used here. e.g., Spraying 2,4-Ethyl\\nEster to rice three weeks after transplanting\\n(ii) Directed spray - Application of herbicides on weeds in between rows of crops by directing the\\nspray only on weeds avoiding the crop. This could be possible by use of protective shield or\\nhood. For example, spraying glyphosate in between rows of tapioca using hood to control\\nCyperus rotundus.\\n(iii) Protected spray - Applying non-selective herbicides on weeds by covering the crops, which are\\nwide spaced, with polyethylene covers etc. This is expensive and laborious. However, farmers\\nare using this technique for spraying glyphosate to control weeds in jasmine, cassava, banana etc.'),\n",

Based on mobility\\nContact herbicide - A contact herbicide kills those plant parts with which it comes in direct contact\\ne.g., Paraquat.\\nTranslocated herbicide - Herbicide which tends to move from treated part to untreated areas\\nthrough xylem/phloem depending on the nature of its molecule e.g., Glyphosate.\\n4. Based on time of application\\nPre-plant application (PPI): Application of herbicide before sowing or along with sowing. Either it is\\nfoliar applied or incorporated in soil soon after its application. Pre-plant foliar spraying of glyphosate\\nto control perennial weeds like Cyperus rotundus and pre-plant soil incorporation of Fluchloralin to\\ncontrol weeds in ground nut.\\nPre-emergence: Herbicide is applied to soil soon after sowing a crop before emergence of weeds.\\ne.g., Atrazine, Pendimethalin, Butachlor, Thiobencarb, Pretilachlor etc.\\nPost-emergence: When herbicide is applied to kill young weeds standing in the crop plants or\\napplication after the emergence of weed and crop. e.g., Glyphosate, Paraquat, 2,4-D Na Salt.\\nEarly post emergence:  Another application of herbicide in the slow growing crops like potato,\\nsugarcane, 2-3 week after sowing is classified as early post emergence.\\n5. Based on molecular structure\\n(a) Inorganic compounds\\n(b) Organic compounds\\nV. Formulations\\nHerbicides in their natural state may be solid, liquid, volatile, non-volatile, soluble or insoluble. Hence,\\nthese have to be made in forms suitable and safe for their field use.

The material is finely ground so that it may form a suspension when\\nagitated with a required volume of water e.g., Atrazine.\\n(iii) Granules (G) - The inert material (carrier) is gi ven a granular shape and the herbicide (active\\ningredient) is mixed with sand, clay, vermiculite , finely ground plant parts (ground corn cobs)\\nas carrier material. e.g., Alachlor granules.\\n(iv) Water soluble concentrates (WSC) e.g., paraquat.\\nVI.  Time of application of herbicides\\n(i) Pre-planting - Application of herbicides before the crop is planted or sown. Soil application as\\nwell as foliar application is done here. For example, fluchloralin can be applied to soil and\\nincorporated before sowing rainfed groundnut while glyphosate can be applied on the foliage of\\nperennial weeds like Cyperus rotundus before planting of any crop.\\n(ii) Pre-emergence - Application of herbicides before a crop or weed has emerged. In case of\\nannual crops application is done after the sowing of the crop but before the emergence of weeds\\nand this is referred as pre-emergence to the crop while in the case perennial crops it can be said\\nas pre-emergence to weeds. For example soil application by spraying of atrazine on 3rd DA T to\\nsugarcane can be termed as pre-emergence to cane crop while soil application by spraying the\\nsame immediately after a rain to control a new flush of weeds in a inter-cultivated orchard can\\nbe specified as pre-emergence to weed.\\n(iii) Post-emergence - Herbicide application after the emergence of crop or weed is referred as post-\\nemergence application. When the weeds grow before the crop plants have emerged through the\\nsoil and are killed with a herbicide then it is called as early post-emergence. For example\\nspraying 2,4-D Na salt to control parasitic weed striga in sugarcane is called as post-emergence\\nwhile spraying of paraquat to control emerged weeds after 10-15 days after planting potato can\\nbe called as early post-emergence.\\nVII. Selective herbicides\\nThe success of weed control programme depends on study of weed flora, selection of proper herbicide,\\nuse of correct dose, stage and time of application, method of application and calibration of sprayer.\\n(a) Factors influencing choice of herbicides\\nCrop factor - Monocots and dicots show differential tolerance to a herbicide, accordingly depending on\\ntype of crop cultivated the choice of herbicides varies. e.g., Monocots like rice has tolerance to 2,4-D\\nNa salt while dicots like soybean gets killed when used as post-emergence.\\nNature of weeds present - Based on the type of major weeds present in a situation, the herbicides\\nare suggested accordingly. For e.g., if more grassy weeds–fluzipop butyl is used while 2,4-D Na salt is\\nused to control broad-leaved weeds.\\nSite of application - Soil applied herbicides–Atrazine, fluchloralin; Foliar applied herbicides–\\nglyphosate.\\nTime of application - Pre-emergence herbicides–metolachlor ; Post-emergence herbicides–paraquat.\\nF\\narming situation - Wetland–water soluble herbicides butachlor; garden land–Wettable powders–\\nAtrazine and water bodies–Diquat.\\nDuration of weed control - Short dura tion–less persistent herbicide-Anilofos; Long period\\n–residual herbicides–atrazine.'),\n",

These chemi cals may undergo a change in physical and\\nchemical characters, which could lead to enhancement or reduction in the efficacy of one or more\\ncompounds. The interaction effects were seen much later in the growing season or in the next season\\ndue to build up of persistent chemicals or their residues in the soil. Knowledge on the interactions of\\nvarious chemicals can be helpful in the formulation and adoption of a sound and effective plant protec-\\ntion programme. It can also help to exploit the synergistic and antagonistic interactions between various\\npesticides for an effective eradication of weed and other pest problems. When two or more chemicals\\naccumulate in the plant, they may interact and bring out responses. These responses are classified as\\nadditive, synergistic, antagonistic, independent and enhancement effects.\\nA. Interaction Effects\\nAdditive effect - It is the total effect of a combination, which is equal to the sum of the effects of the\\ncomponents taken independently.\\nSynergistic effect - The total effect of a combination is greater or more prolonged than the sum of\\nthe effects of the two taken independently. e.g., The mixture of 2,4-D and chlorpropham is synergistic\\non monocot species generally resistant to 2,4-D. Similarly, low rates of 2,4-D and picloram have\\nsynergistic response on Convolvulus arvensis. Atrazine and Alachlor combination, which shows synergism\\nis widely used for an effective control in corn.\\nAntagonistic effect - The total effect of a combination is smaller than the effect of the most active\\ncomponent applied alone. e.g., combination of EPTC with 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T or dicamba has antagonistic\\nresponses in sorghum and giant foxtail. Similarly, c hlorpropham and 2,4-D have antagonism. When\\nsimazine or atrazine is added to glyphosate solution and sprayed the glyphosa te activity is reduced.\\nThis is due to the physical binding within the spray solution rather than from biological interactions\\nwithin the plant.'),\n",

Herbicide-moisture Interaction\\nSoil applied herbicides fail when there is a dry spell of 10-15 days after their application. Pre-emer-\\ngence herbicides may be lost by photo-decomposition, v olatilization and wind blowing while some\\namount of water is desirable to activate the soil applied herbicides, excess of it may leach the herbicide\\nto the crop seed and root zone. This may injure the crops and on other side, result in poor weed control.\\nHeavy showers may wash down herbicides from the foliage. Continuous wet weather may induce\\nherbicide injury in certain crops by turning them highly succulent. e.g., maize plants ar e normally\\ntolerant to Atrazine but they become susceptible in wet weather, particularly when air temperature is\\nlow. Extra succulence has been found to increase atrazine absorption and low temperature decrease its\\nmetabolism inside the plants. Quality of water used may also determine herbicide action. Dusty water\\nreduces action of paraquat. Calcium chloride ri ch water reduces glyphoste phytotoxicity.\\nC. Herbicide-insecticide Interaction\\nThese chemicals are usually not har mful at recommended rates. The tolerance of plants to a herbicide\\nmay be altered in the presence of an insecticide and vice versa. The phyto-toxicity of monuron and\\ndiuron on cotton and oats is increased when applied with phorate. Phorate interacts antagonistically\\nwith trifluralin to increase cotton yield, by stimulating secondary roots in the zone of pesticide incor-\\nporation. Propanil interacts with certain carbamate and phosphate insecticides used as seed treatments\\non rice. But chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides as seed treatment have not interacted with propanil.\\nWhen propanil is applied at intervals between 7 and 56 days after carbofuron treatment, it results in\\ngreater injury to rice vegetatively.\\nD. Herbicide-pathogens/fungicides Interaction\\nHerbicides interact with fungicides also. Dinoseb reduces the severity of stem rot in groundnut. In\\nsterilized soil, chloroxuron is not causing any apparent injury to pea plants, while in the presence of\\nRhizoctonia solani in unsterilized soil it causes injury. Oxadiazon reduces the incidence of stem rot\\ncaused by the soil borne pathogen Sclerotium rolfsii L. in groundnut. Diuron and triazine, which inhibit\\nphotosynthesis, may make the plants more susceptible to tobacco mosaic virus. On the other hand,\\ndiuron may decrease the incidence of root rot in wheat.\\nE. Herbicide-fertilizer Interaction\\nHerbicides have been found to interact with fertilizers in fields. e.g., fast growing weeds that are getting\\nample nitrogen show great susceptibility to 2, 4-D, glyphosate than slow growing weeds on poor\\nfertility lands. The activity of glyphosate is increased when ammonium sulphate is tank mixed.\\nNitrogen invigorate (put life and energy into) the meristamatic activity in crops so much that they\\nsusceptible to herbicides. High rates of atrazine are more toxic to maize and sorghum when applied\\nwith high rates of phosphorus.\\nF.

Definition\\nUse of a judicial combination of mechanical, cultural,  biological and chemical methods to achieve\\neconomic and effective weed control. It is a method whereby all economically, ecologically and\\ntoxicologically justifiable methods are employed to keep the harmful organisms below the threshold\\nlevel of economic damage, keeping in the foreground the conscious employment of natural limiting\\nfactors.\\nIWM is the rational use of direct and indirect control methods to provide cost-effective weed\\ncontrol. Such an appr oach is the most attractive  alternative from agronomic, economic and ecological\\npoint of view. Among the commonly suggested indirect methods are land preparation, water manage-\\nment, plant spacing, seed rate, cultivar use, and fertilizer application. Direct methods include manual,\\ncultural, mechanical and chemical methods of weed control. The essential factor in any IWM pro-\\ngramme is the number of indirect and direct methods that can be combined economically in a given\\nsituation. For example, increased frequency of ploughing and harrowing does not eliminate the need for\\ndirect weed control. It is, therefore, more cost-effective to use fewer pre-planting harrowing and com-\\nbine them with direct weed control methods. There is experimental evidence that illustrates that better\\nweed control is achieved if different weed control practices are used in combination rather than if they\\nare applied separately.\\nB. Why IWM\\n\\x7f One method of weed control may be effective and economical in a situation and it may not be\\nso in other situation.\\n\\x7f No single herbicide is effective in controlling wide range of weed flora.\\n\\x7f Continuous use of same herbicide creates resistance in escaped weed flora or causes shift in the\\nflora.\\n\\x7f Continuous use of only one practice may result in some undesirable effects. e.g., Rice–wheat\\ncropping system–Philaris minor.\\n\\x7f Only one method of weed control may lead to increase in population of particular weed.\\n\\x7f Indiscriminate herbicide use and its effects on the environment and human health.\\nC. Concept\\n\\x7f Uses a variety of technologies in a single weed management with the objective to produce\\noptimum crop yield at a minimum cost taking into consideration ecological and socio-economic\\nconstraints under a given agro-ecosystem.\\n\\x7f A system in which two or more methods are used to control a weed. These methods may include\\ncultural practices, na tural enemies and selective herbicides.\\nD. Good IWM should be\\n\\x7f Flexible enough to incorporate innovations and practical experiences of local farmers.'),\n",

(Take water in a beaker, if you dip a leaf of\\nCynodon dactylon and pull it back, you can see the leaf without wetting. But if you add a drop of\\nsurfactant you can readily wet the foliage.). With the ad dition of surfactant, the water drop flattens\\ndown to wet the leaf surface and let the herbicide act properly.\\n2. Stabilizing agents - These include emulsifiers and dispersing agents.\\n(i) Emulsifiers - A substance which stabilizes (reduces the tendency to separate) a suspension\\nof droplets of one liquid which otherwise would not mix with the first one. It substitutes for\\nconstant agitation of spray liquids during field operation.\\nE.g., ABS, Solved, 15-5-3, 15-5-9.\\n(ii) Dispersing agents - They stabilize suspensions. They keep fine parricides of wettable\\npowder in suspension in water even after initial vigorous agitation has been withdrawn.\\nThey act by increasing the hydration of fine particles of WP laden with the herbicides.\\n3. Coupling agents (Solvents and co-solvents) - Chemical that is used to solubilize a herbicide in\\na concentrated form; the resulting solution is soluble with water in all proportions. e.g., 2,4-D\\nis insoluble in water, but it can be dissolved in pol yethylene glycol to make it water soluble.\\nCommon solvents: Benzene, acetone, petroleum ether, carbon tetrachloride.\\n4. Humicants (Hygroscopic agents) - Humicants prevent rapid drying of herbicide sprays on the\\nfoliage, thus providing an extended opportunity of herbicide absorption e.g., glycerol.\\n5. Deposit builders (Stickers or filming agents) - Chemicals added to herbicide concentrates to\\nhold the toxicant in intimate contact with the plant surface. They also reduce washing off of the\\ntoxicant from the treated foliage by rain. e.g., several petroleum oils, Dupont spreader sticker,\\nCitowett.\\n6. Compatibility agents - Used to intimately mix fertilizers and pesticides in spray liquids e.g.,\\nCompex.\\n7. Activators (Synergists) - Chemicals having cooperative action with herbicides that the resultant\\nphytotoxicity is more than the effect of the two working independently. e.g., Paraffinic oils,\\nAmmonium thiocyanate, Urea and Ammonium chloride to enhance 2,4–D phytotoxicity.\\n8. Drift control agents - Herbicide spray drifts may pose serious hazards to non-target plants.\\ne.g., 2,4–D on cotton. Solution is to spray herbicide liquids in large droplets.\\n9.

Use of Optimum Dose of Herbicide\\nHazards from residues of herbicides can be minimized by the application of chemicals at the lowest\\ndosage by which the desired weed control is achieved. Besides, applying herbicides in bands rather as\\nbroadcast will reduce the total amount of herbicide to be a pplied. This will be practicable in line sown\\ncrops or crops raised along ridges, such as cotton, sugarcane, sorghum, maize etc.\\nB. Application of Farm Yard Manure\\nFarmyard manure application is an effective method to mitigate the residual toxicity of herbicides. The\\nherbicide molecules get adsorbed in their colloidal fraction and make them unavailable for crops and\\nweeds. Besides, FYM enhances the microbial activity, which in turn degrades the herbicide at a faster\\nrate.\\nC. Ploughing/cultivating the Land\\nPloughing with disc plough or interculti vators reduces the herbicide toxicity, as the applied herbicide\\nis mixed to a large volume of soil and g ets diluted. In case of deep ploughing the herbicide layer is\\ninverted and buried in deeper layers and thereby the residual toxicity got reduced.\\nD.

Fluchloralin 0.9 kg or butachlor 0.75 kg/ha + Hand weeding at 35 DA T for ragi + sunflower\\n(border crop), pendimethalin 1.0 kg/ha + hand weeding on 35 DAS for cotton intercropped with onion\\nand two manual weeding at 15 and 35 DAS for sorghum inter cropped with cowpea is the recommended\\nweed control practice. The above weed management schedule did not show any residual effect in the\\ncropping system because the herbicides are changed for every crop.\\nE. Use of Non-Phyto-Toxic Oil\\nAtrazine residual hazard could be reduced by mixing non-phyto-toxic oil, w hich would also enhance\\nthe weed killing potency.\\nF. Use of Activated Carbon\\nActivated carbon has a high adsorptive capacity because of its tremendous surface area which vary\\nfrom 600–1200 m2/g. Incorporation of 50 kg/ha of activated charcoal inactivated completely chlorsulfuron\\napplied at 1.25 and 2.50 kg/ha and did not affect the yield of maize compared to untreated control.\\nApplication of charcoal at 5.0 kg/ha along the seed line reduced the residual toxicity of atrazine in\\nsoybean crop.\\nG. Use of Safeners and Antidotes\\nA new development in herbicide usage is the use of safeners and antidotes in order to protect the crop\\nplant from possible damage by a herbicide. This means that it may be possible to use certain herbicides\\non crops that would nor mally be affected by herbicide. NA (1,8-naphthalic anhydride) has been used\\nas a seed dressing on rice to protect the crop ag ainst molinate and alachlor. Another herbicide safener\\ncyometrinil is used along with metolachlor in grain sorghum and other crop species.\\nH.

Rainfall\\n(a) Characteristics\\n\\x7f Quantity should be sufficient to replace the moisture depleted from the root zone.\\n\\x7f Frequency should be so as to maintain the crop without any water stress before it starts to wilt.\\n\\x7f Intensity should be low enough to suit the soil absorption capacity.\\nIndian rainfall does not have the above good characteristics to maintain the crop through rainfall\\nalone. The following are the characteristic features of Indian rainfall.\\n\\x7f Annual average rainfall is 1190 mm.\\n\\x7f There is wide variation in the quantity of rainfall received from place to place. Highly erratic,\\nundependable, variation in seasonal rainfall either in excess or deficit is the nature of Indian\\nrainfall. For example a place in Rajasthan receives practically nil rainfall at the same time\\nChirapunji about 3000 mm rainfall.\\n\\x7f Rainfall is not uniformly distributed throughout the year. It is seasonal, major quantity is in the\\nSouth West Monsoon, (SWM alone contributing 70% of total rainfall) i.e., in the month of June\\nto September followed by North-East Monsoon (NEM) from October to December. In summer\\nand winter the amount of rainfall is very little.\\n\\x7f With in the season also the distribution is not uniform. A sudden heavy downpour followed by\\ndry spell for a long period is common occurrence.\\n\\x7f Rainfall distribution over a large number of days is more effe ctive than heavy down pour in a\\nshort period, but it is in negative trend in India.\\n\\x7f Late commencement of monsoon.\\n\\x7f Early withdrawal of monsoon and liability to failure are the freakish behaviour of Indian rainfall.\\nTimely and uniform distribution of rainfall is important for better crop planning and to sustain\\ncrop production.'),\n",

This civilization came to an end w hen the irrigation system failed to maintain crop\\nproduction. There are some evidences that during the V edic period (400 B.C.) people used to irrigate\\ntheir crops with dug well water. Irrigation was gradually developed and extended during the Hindus,\\nMuslims and British periods.\\nThe Grand Anaicut (KALLANAI) constructed across the river Cauvery is an outstanding example\\nfor the irrigation work by a Chola king the great Karikala Cholan during second century. The\\nV eeranarayanan Tank and Gangai Konda Cholapur am tank was constructed during 10th century in\\nTamil Nadu. Anantaraja Sagar in Andhra Pradesh was constructed during 13th century. Early Mauryan\\nking Samudragupta and Ashoka took great interest in the construction of wells and tanks. Later Moghul\\nkings or North India and Hindu kings of South India focused their attention, in the establishment of\\ncanals, dams, tanks etc. British Government initiated their work during 19th century in remodeling and\\nrenovation of the existing irrigation system. The Upper Ganga canal, Krishna and Godaveri delta\\nsystem, Mettur and Periyar dams are the great irrigation structures bu ilt by the British rulers. After\\nindependence, Irrigation activities have been accelerated and number of multipurpose river valley\\nprojects like Bhakra-nangal in Punjab, Tungabhadra in Andhra Pradesh, Damodar Valley in Madhya\\nPradesh were established.\\nA. Irrigation Development During Five Year Plans\\nIn 1950-51, the gross irrigated  area was 22.5 m.ha. After completion of 1st five-year plan, the gross\\nirrigated area was enlarged to 26.2 m.ha. Further, it was gradually increased to 29, 35.5, 44.2, 53.5 and\\n55 m.ha respectively over the II, III, IV , V , VI and VII five years plans. The expected increase through\\nVIII and IX five year plans area 95 and 105 m.ha. respectively.\\nB. CLassification of Irrigation Work or Projects\\nThe irrigation projects can be classified as: (1) major, (2) medium (3) minor based on financial limits\\nor expenditure involved in the scheme.\\nMajor–More than Rs. 50 million - It covers cultural command area of more than 10,000 ha.\\nMedium–Rs. 2.5-50 million - It covers cultural command area of 2000–10,000 ha.\\nMinor–less than Rs. 2.5 million - It covers cultural command area of 2,000 hectares.\\nThe minor irrigation work consists of irrigation tanks, canals and diversion work for the welfare of\\nsmall farmers.\\nIndia has many perennial and seasonal rivers, which flow from outside and within the country.\\nAmong this, some important rivers of different states are given below.'),\n",

The\\nremaining 55 rainy days are very light and shallow which evaporates immediately without any\\ncontribution to surface or ground water recharge. Considering all these factors it is estimated that out\\nof 400 m.ha. meter of annual rainfall 70 m.ha. meter is lost to atmosphere through evaporation and\\ntranspiration, about 115 m.ha. meter flo ws as surface run-off and remaining 215 m.ha. meter soaks or\\ninfiltrates into the soil profile.\\nE.

The source of water\\nmay be anything like wells, tanks, artisan wells of canals of rivers.\\nWater requirement - Crop water requirement is the water required by the plants for its survival,\\ngrowth, development and to produce economic parts. This requirement is a pplied either naturally by\\nprecipitation or artificially by irrigation. Hence the crop water requirement includes all losses like:\\n\\x7f Transpiration loss through leaves (T).\\n\\x7f Evaporation loss through soil surface in cropped area (E).\\n\\x7f Amount of water used by plants (WP) for its metabolic activities, which is, estimated as less than\\n1% of the total water absorption. These three components cannot be separated so easily. Hence,\\nthe ET loss is taken as crop water use or crop water consumptive use.\\n\\x7f Other application losses are conveyance loss, percolation loss, runoff loss etc., (WL).\\n\\x7f The water required for special purpose (WSP) like puddling operation, ploughing operation,\\nland preparation, leaching requirement, for the purpose of weeding for dissolving fertilizers and\\nchemicals etc.\\nHence, the water requirement is symbolically represented as:\\nWR = T + E + WP + WL + WSP\\nThe other application losses and special purposes are mostly indented for wetland cultivation.\\nHence, for garden land crop, the ET loss alone is accounted for crop water requirement. The estimation\\nof the water requirement of crop is one of the basic needs for crop planning in the farm and for the\\nplanning of any irrigation project. Water requir ement includes the losses due to ET or CU and losses\\nduring the application of irrigation water and the quantity of water required for special purposes or\\noperations such as land preparation, transplanting, leaching etc. Hence, it may be formulated as follows\\nfor demand point of view as;\\nWR = ET or Cu + application loss + water for special needs.\\nIt can also be stated based on supply source as follows:\\nWR = IR + ER + S\\nWhere,\\nIR - Irrigation requirement\\nER - Effective rainfall\\nS - Contribution from groundwater table.\\nHence, the idea about crop wa ter requirement is essential for farm planning with respect to total\\nquantity of water needed and its efficient use of various cropping schemes of the farm or project area.\\nThis crop water requirement is also needed to decide the stream size and design the canal capacity.

This is also known as crop water demand.\\n11.4.1  Evaporation\\nEvaporation is defined as the process by which water moves out of the water surface or soil surface in\\nthe form of water vapour to atmosphere due to pressure gradient. Evaporation from natural surface such\\nas open water, bare soil or vegetative cover is a diffusive process by which water in the form of vapour\\nis transferred from the underlying surface to the atmosphere. The essential requirement for evaporation\\nprocess are:\\n\\x7f Source of heat energy to vaporize the irrigated water.\\n\\x7f The presence of a concentration gradient of water vapour between the evaporating surface and\\nsurrounding air of atmosphere.\\nEvaporation can occur only when vapour concentra tion of evaporating surface exceeds that of the\\nsurrounding air. The sources of heat energy are solar energy and wind energy. The energy required for\\nevaporation is 590 calories per gram of water to evaporate at 20 oC. The fundamental principle of\\nevaporation from a free surface has indicated evaporation as the function of difference in the vapour\\npressure of water surface and the vapour pressure of air.\\nMeasurement of evaporation - This can be made by the following methods.\\n\\x7f Pan evaporimeter\\n\\x7f Tin can evaporimeter\\n\\x7f Pitche evaporimeter\\n1. Pan Evaporimeter- Evaporimeter is an instrument which integrates the effect of all the different\\nclimatic elements and furnishes their combined effect. It is relatively simple, cheap and more\\nuseful in irrigation practices.\\n2. “U.S.W.B. Class A pan” Evaporimeter - It is the standard type used globally. It is made of GI\\npan having a diameter of 120 cm with a depth of 25 cm. It is painted with white colour to reduce\\nheat absorption and mounted on a wooden platform at a height of 15 cm from ground level to\\nreduce the effect of soil temperature. The water level is measured by the Hook gauge or a fixed\\nscale attached to a stilling well. The pan is covered with a mesh to prevent animals’ and bird’s\\ndisturbances to the water. Evaporation is recorded at a fixed time in the still well by adding water\\nin the evaporimeter to compensate the daily loss of water by evaporation. Evaporimeter is to be\\ncleaned periodically and tested for it’s leakage. Development of algae etc., should be avoided.\\n3. “Tin can” evaporimeter - A small tin is fitted with a scale and water is filled in the tin and kept\\nin the cropped field at different locations. The daily loss will be taken as evaporation.\\n4. “Pitche” evaporimeter - It consists of a graduated tube of 30 cm with one open end and\\ncovered by a drier paper and is attac hed in a metallic stand. The tube is filled with water and\\nturned upside down. The water slowly wets the paper and evaporates and the water loss in the\\ntube is considered as a measurement of evaporation.

Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates in the form of water vapour from living\\nplant body especially from leaves to atmosphere. It involves a continuous movement of water from soil\\nto atmosphere through root, stem and leaves. The rate of transpiration depends on:\\n\\x7f Supply of energy to vapourise the water, and\\n\\x7f The water vapour concentration gradient at atmosphere.\\nIt is further influenced by the climatic, soil and plant factors.\\nClimatic factors - Light intensity, temperature and wind.\\nSoil factors - Texture, infiltration rate, water holding capacity, field capacity, moisture-releasing\\npattern etc.\\nPlant factors - Root system, leaf area, leaf arrangements, leaf structure, stomatal behaviour, etc.\\n11.4.3 Evapotranspiration or Consumptive Use\\nIt is very difficult to separate the losses due to evaporation and transpiration in a cropped field. Hence,\\nthese two processes are combined to a term called Evapo-Transpiration (ET). These two losses are\\nconsidered as water used for plant growth and hence it can be considered as Consumptive Use (CU).\\nThe consumptive use includes all water consumed by the plants and the water evaporated from bare\\nland and water surface in the area occupied by the crop plants.\\nFactors affecting ET\\n\\x7f Solar radiation which supplies energy for ET.\\n\\x7f Wind, which removes the water vapour from cropped area and makes changes in water vapour\\nconcentration gradient.\\n\\x7f Temperature which increases ET rate.\\n\\x7f Relative humidity which changes the ET rate due to changes in water vapour gradient.

Or it can also be stated that ET from the full y covered vegetative area under unlimited water\\navailable at all the times. This concept was suggested by Thornthwait in 1948. Further, Jensen in 1968\\nassumed that PET is the upper limit of ET that would occur with a well-irrigated, well-grown agricultural\\ncrop, it is also known as reference evapotranspiration and denoted as ET0. It can be calculated by four\\nempirical methods using different climatic components suggested by irrigation scientists. They are:\\n(1) Blaney and Criddle, (2) Radiation method, (3) Pan evaporation method, (4) Modified pennman\\nmethod. The reference crop evaporation (ET 0) can be obtained from\\nET0 = Kp × E pan\\nWhere,\\nKp  = Pan coefficient\\nE pan = Mean evaporation in mm/day\\nThe Kp values for different agro  climatic conditions have been already standardiz ed (Refer-Table\\n18. From FAO Irrigation and Drainage paper 24). For our condition, 0.8 can be taken as Kp value.\\n(a) Selection of crop coefficient for estimating ET - The value of ET need to be adjusted for actual crop\\nET, since under natural field condition PET rarely occurs in most of the irrigated field crops. Normally\\nthe PET will occur in low land rice and two to three days after irrigation or rain in garden land\\ncondition. For converting ET0 value into ET crop, suitable crop coefficients (denoted as Kc) should be\\nevolved for different crops, soil,  climate and different stages of crops. Crop coefficient is the ratio\\nbetween ET crop and ET 0.\\nET crop = Kc × Eto\\n0\\nEt cropKc ET=\\nThis ratio is usually 0.2 during early growth stage and about 1.0 when the crop develops maximum\\ncanopy and root system. The ratio again gets reduced as the crop approaches maturity. V alue of crop\\nfactors have to be worked out for local situation.\\n(b) Seasonal consumptive use  - It is the total water requirement for the crop growing periods to\\nmeet the ET loss. Hence, it can be stated as the total water used in evapotranspiration by cropped area\\nduring the entire growing season, which is called as seasonal consumptive use. It is expressed as depth\\nof water in cm. This value is used to evaluate and determine the seasonal irrigation water requirement.\\nSeasonal consumptive use values are required to evaluate and determine the seasonal irrigation water\\nsupplies.\\n(c) Peak period consumptive use - The highest consumptive use for certain period in the growth\\nseason is called the peak period consumptive use. This value is used in the planning and designing of\\nirrigation system. The peak period consumptive use will vary from soil to soil and from crop to crop.\\nIn the irrigation project designs, this peak period CU will be accounted for proper planning and use of\\nthe available water effectively for different cropping pattern. This peak use rate also varies in different\\nclimatic conditions.

Irrigation Frequency\\nIrrigation frequency is the interval between tw o consecutive irrigations during crop periods. Irrigation\\nfrequency is the number of days between irrigations during crop periods without rainfall. It depends\\nupon the rate of uptake of water by plants a nd soil moisture supply capacity to plant and soil moisture\\navailable in the root zone. Hence, it is a function of crop, soil and climate. Normally irrigation should\\nbe given at about 50 per cent and not over 60 per cent depletion of the available moisture from the\\neffective root zone in w hich most of the roots ar e concentrated. In designing irrigation system, the\\nirrigation frequency to be used is the time (days) between two irrigations in the period of highest\\nconsumptive use of crop growth, i.e., peak consumptive use of crop.\\nDesign frequency (days)\\nFC moisture content of the root zone prior to starting irrigation\\nPeak period consumptive use rate of crop\\n−=\\nIrrigation period - Irrigation period is the n umber of days that can be a llowed for applying one\\nirrigation to a given design area during peak consumptive use period of the crop.\\n()Net amount of moisture in soil at start of irri gation FC-PWPIrrigation period Peak period consumptive use of the crop=\\nGrowth duration - Growth duration of different crops varies considerably.

Crops like sugarcane,\\nand banana take more than a year and are referred as annual or biennial crops and plantation crops like\\ncoconut, tea, coffee etc., which take one to several years for their growth are referred to as perennial\\ncrops.

All the rainfall received are not used by the crops because of its\\nerratic nature such as untimeliness, lesser or higher quantity etc. The useful portions of rainfall which\\nis stored in soil and supplied to the crop for its consumptive use is called effective rainfall. The term\\neffective rainfall has been interpreted differently by different specialists. To a canal engineer, the rain which\\nreaches the storage reservoir is the effective portion. To a hydro electrical engineer, the rainfall which is\\nuseful for running the turbines that generate electricity is effective. To an agriculturist, the portion of total\\nrainfall that directly satisfies crop water needs and also the surface run off which can be stored and used\\nfor crop production is considered as effective rainfall. The rainwater which moves out of the field by\\nsurface runoff and deep percolation beyond the root zone of the crop are ineffective rainfall.\\nA. Factors influencing ER\\nSeveral factors influence the proportion of effective rainfall and these may act singly or collectively and\\ninteract with each other.'),\n",

The methods of irrigation initially might have been started to check the over flow of water\\nfrom one field to another. But today, it has become necessary to save the water by proper methods to\\narrest run-off loss, percolation loss, evaporation loss etc., and to optimize the crop water need. Hence,\\nirrigation method can be defined as the way in w hich the water is applied to the cropped field without\\nmuch application and other losses, with an objective of a pplying water effectively to facilitate better\\nenvironment for crop growth.\\n11.7.1 Factors Influencing Irrigation Methods\\nSoil type - The soil physical properties such as texture, structure, porosity, infiltration rate, etc. influence\\nthe selection of irrigation methods. Heavy texture soil restricts water movement than light texture soil\\nwherein water move freely to deeper sections due to high porosity. Single grain structure soil allows\\nwater freely to move downward compared to other structures\\nSoil depth - If soil is shallow which holds less water, lev eling and forming bunds etc. to hold\\nmaximum water to increase the irrigation interval. Similarly if the soil is deep, it holds more water and\\nneeds longer irrigation interval.

The end along the\\nstrip may or may not be closed, which is based on the length of the strips. If the length of the\\nstrip is very long, the end will be closed to have a uniform distribution and to avoid run off loss.\\nEach strip is irrigated independently from upper end (turned on) and water flow as thin sheet and\\nuniformly spread along the strips.

Ring basin - This method is mostly adopted for wide spaced orchard crops. The rings are\\ncircular basins formed around the individual trees. The rings between trees are interlinked with\\nmain lead channel by sub channels to get water to the individual rings. As water is allowed in\\nrings only, wastage of water spreading the whole interspaces of trees as in the usual flooding\\nirrigation method is reduced. Weed growth in the interspaces around the rings are discouraged.\\nThis method ensures sufficient moisture in the root zone and saves lot of irrigation water.\\n5. Furrow method of irrigation - It is the common method adopted for row planted crops like\\ncotton, maize, sugarcane, potato, beetroot, onion, sorghum, vegetable crops etc. In this method,\\nsmall evenly spaced shallow furrows or channels are formed in the beds. Another method of\\nfurrow irrigation is forming alternate ridges and furrows to regulate water. The water is turned\\nat the high end and conveyed through smaller channels. Water applied in furrows infiltrate\\nslowly into the soil and spread laterally to wet the area between furrows.\\nFig. 11.3 Ring basin'),\n",

Dimensions\\nBased on the soil slope and stream size, the length can be fixed. The furrow width or spacing varies\\nfrom 60–120 cm, which depends upon the crop to be grown. The depth of furrow varies from 12.5 cm,\\nwhich depends upon ( a) soil type, ( b) flow size, and ( c) effective root zone depth of crop.\\nB.  Suitability\\nThis method is mostly suitable for medium to moderately fine textured soil which allows free water\\nmovement both horizontally and vertically. In sandy or coarse textured soil, this method is not suitable\\nbecause here the water movement is primarily downwa rd and very little in horizontal direction.\\nBesides, the length of ridges or furrows to resist the velocity of flow is very low which in turn may lead\\nto breaching of the structures. This method is adopted for soils having the problem of surface crust or\\nhardpan. The labour requirement to form the furrows is relatively higher than other surface methods of\\nirrigation.\\nC.  Precautions\\nWhile using the furrow method of irrigation, care must be taken in strengthening the furrow since\\nerosion hazard on sloppy areas may damage the furrow. To work out the maximum non-erosive flow in\\nthe area, the below mentioned empirical formula can be used.\\n0.60Q\\nS\\n=\\nWhere,\\nQ = Maximum non-erosive stream in lps.\\n0.60 = Constant\\nS = Slope of the furrow in percentage\\nIrrigation furrows may be classified into two general types viz., straight furrow and contour furrow.\\nStraight furrow - Best suited to soils where land slope does not exceed 0.75%.\\nContour furrow - This method is similar to graded and level furrow method. Furrow carries water\\nacross slopping field rather than downwards. They are designed to fit the topography of field.\\nFurrows are given a gentle slope along its le ngth as in graded furrow. Field supply channels run\\ndown the land slope to feed the contour furrow and ar e provided with erosi on control structure.\\nSuccessfully used in all irrigable soils. All row crops including grains, vegetables and cash crops\\nare adapted to this method. Light soil can be irrigated successfully across slopes up to 5% slope.\\nUp to 8-10% can be irrigated by contour furrow. Contour furrow may be used on all types of soil\\nexcept in light sandy soil and soil that crack.\\nCorrugation irrigation - It consists of running water in small furrows, which direct the flow down\\nthe slope commonly used for irrigation in non-cultivated close growing crops such as small grains,\\npasture on steep slopes. Corrugation can be made with a simple bamboo corrugation or cultivators\\nequipped with small furrows. Corrugations ar e ‘V’ or ‘U’ shaped channels about 6-10 cm deep\\nspaced 40-75 cm apart. This method is not recommended f or saline soil or for saline water irriga-\\ntion. The permissible length of corrugation varies from 15 cm within light textured soil with slopes\\nof 2-4% to about 150 cm in heavy te xture soil up to 2% slope.\\nFurrow irrigation design consideration - Efficient irrigation by furrow method is obtained by\\nselection of proper combination of spacing, length and slope furrows.'),\n",

Crops like potato, maize, cotton, etc., are planted 60–90 cm\\napart and have furrow between all rows. Carrot, lettuce and onion are spaced 30–40 cm and\\noften have two rows between furrows. Furrows should be close enough to ensure that water\\nspreads to the sides of the ridge and the root zone of crop to replenish soil moisture imme-\\ndiately.\\n(ii) Furrow length - Optimum length furrow is usually the longest furrow that can be efficiently\\nand safely irrigated. Long furrows are an advantage in inter cultivation. Proper furrow\\nlength depends largely on hydraulic conductivity of soil. It should be shorter in porous\\nsandy soil than clayey soil. If only a small area is to be irrigated, the length of field may\\ndetermine the length of furrow. In large area it may be desirable to have furrow length equal\\nto an even fraction of the total length of the field.\\n(iii) Furrow slope - The slope or grade of furrow is important because it controls the speed at\\nwhich water flows down the furrow. A minimum furrow gradient of 0.05% is needed to\\nensure Surface drainage.\\n(iv) Furrow stream - The size of the furrow stream is one factor which can be varied after\\nfurrow irrigation system can be installed. The size of furrow stream usually varies from\\n0.5-2.5 lit/sec. The max nonerosive low rate in furrow is estimated by following equation,\\nqm = 0.6/S\\n         where,\\nqm = maximum no-erosion stream (lit/sec)\\nS = Slope of furrow (%)\\nAverage depth of irrigation water applied during irrigation can be calculated by the following\\nrelationship.\\nD = (q × 360 × t)/(w × l)\\nWhere\\nD = Average depth of water applied (cm)\\nq = Stream size (lit/sec)\\nt = duration of irrigation (hrs)\\nl = Furrow length (m)\\nw = Furrow width (m)\\n6. Surge irrigation - Surge irrigation is a method of surf ace irrigation through furrows or border\\nstrips wherein water is applied intermittently in a series of relatively short on and off time\\nperiods during the irrigation (Humphrey, 1989). Water is let into a long furrows or border strips\\nin an intermittent flow instead of conventional continuous flow. Each flow is termed as a surge.\\nSurge irrigation practiced under favourable conditions can improve the performance of surface\\nirrigation system compared to the other methods of surface irrigation. Irrigation is given in an\\non-off cycle or by cut back method. The cycle time means the time from the beginning of one\\nsurge to the beginning of next surge. Cycle ratio is the ratio of flow time (continue) to the cycle\\ntime. Assuming the cycle time as 20 minutes and cycle ratio as 1:2 (0.5), the on-time is 10\\nminutes and off time is 10 minutes. This cycle ratio can also be the ratio of on-time and off-time\\nas 1:1, if the on time is 10 minutes. Water is allowed for 10 minutes and stopped for 10 minutes.\\nThis 20 minutes is the surge time or cycle time. This surge is repeated until the water reaches the\\nwhole furrow or strip.'),\n",

When the next surge is allowed to flow along the first surge length,\\nwater makes faster to the second surge length. Thus in surge flow, the advancing water along the\\nfurrow is faster resulting in uniform wetting fr om the head to the tail end of furrow. Under the\\nconventional continuous flow, wetting is more in head end than at tail end. When more water is\\nallowed to increase the wetting depth in the tail end, it leads to loss of water through tail end run\\noff.

Rain gun\\nFeatures of the raingun - Raingun is a powerful mega sprinkler th at throws a large amount of water\\n(upto 500 liters per minute) to a good distance (r adius of 90 feet and even more) as artificial rain. It\\noffers a number of benefits to the farmer. It reduces water consumption by 50 per cent as compared to\\nflood irrigation in achieving the same yield. As a result of the reduced water consumption with the\\nraingun irrigation system, large savings accrue. Irrigation time comes down (60 percent time is saved)\\nand power consumption comes down. Also, raingun irrigation is less labour intensive than flood irriga-\\ntion. It increases crop yield by 10 percent as sugarcane farmers have experienced. Fertilizers can also\\nbe applied with the raingun irrigation system, reducing consumption of fertilizers. Irrigation with the\\nraingun washes away pests like aphids, white flies etc. The raingun irrigation systems supports the\\nhighly recommended practice of trash mulching in sug arcane, which is a process of converting trash\\ninto nutrient for the crop. As the cane grows, the trash is stripped from the cane so that the cane is\\nprotected from pests and diseases. At the same time, the trash is valuable as it has a lot of nutrients.\\nHowever, farmers do not make ready use of this available nutrient and resort to clearing it or setting it\\non fire to manage the huge quantity of trash. Mulching is a practice whereby the trash is used as a soil\\ncover to aid moisture retention, prevent proliferation of weeds and the trash itself is eventually con-\\nverted into nutrition. The raingun irrigation system gives farmers the ability to practice trash mulching\\nsuccessfully.\\nWhile the raingun has been developed with sugarcane in mind, it can also be applied with excellent\\nresults to a number of other crops such as groundnut, tapioca, onion, potato, maize and forage crops etc.\\nPermanent system - In permanent system of installation raingun riser stands are permanently fitted\\nto solid set pipeline network. Riser can also be supported by cement concrete block around the riser.'),\n",

The following are some important system.\\n\\x7f Gravity irrigation\\n\\x7f Tank irrigation\\n\\x7f Lift irrigation\\n11.8.1 Gravity Irrigation\\nHere water is supplied to the land by gravitational flow. There are two types namely ( i) Perennial,\\n(ii) Inundation.\\n(i) Perennial - In this system, water is assured throughout the crop period from the reservoir. This\\nmay be either direct or indirect irrigation. In direct irrigation, river water is directly directed to\\ncanal by constructing diversion weirs across the river without storing water at any point, where\\nadequate perennial supply of water is assured to feed the canal during the cropping period. In\\nindirect irrigation, during monsoon period water is stored in dam or any reservoirs and directed\\nto flow during cropping season and hence also called as storage irrigations. This is adopted\\nwhere the river flow is inadequate in cropping period. This has got significant importance than\\ndirect one.\\n(ii) Inundation - In this system, the water is directed to canal without any diversion work. It\\ndepends on the periodical rise in water levels of the river and supply is drawn through natural\\ncoarse or open which acts as Head.\\n11.8.2 Tank Irrigation\\nIt is the oldest irrigation system of India wherein water is stored by forming a big bund across the\\nnatural drainage to avoid the surface runoff loss through natural streams. The tank size varies according\\nto the drainage capacity. It has irrigation capacity from 10–1000 ha. It is further classified as:\\n(a) System tank - The system tank receives allotted quantity of water from river system during the\\ncropping period for its command.\\n(b) Non-system tanks - The Non-system tanks depend upon rainf all in their catchment area and do\\nnot have any link to river system to get water.'),\n",

Since only the quantity of water necessarily to accomplish\\nthe dilution is involved, there is no necessary to measur e velocity, depth, head, c.s. area etc. After\\nassessing the amount of water to be applied to the soil and the type of water measuring device, the\\nirrigator is to work out the time duration to supply water. This method is yet to become popular in India.\\n11.10 IRRIGATION SCHEDULING\\nIrrigation scheduling is defined as the frequency with which water is to be applied based on needs of\\nthe crop and nature of the soil. Irrigation sc heduling is nothing but number of irrigations and their\\nfrequency required to meet the crop water requirement. Irrigation scheduling may be defined as scien-\\ntific management technique of allocating irrigation water based on the individual crop water require-\\nment (ETc) under different soil and climatic condition, with an aim to achieve maximum crop produc-\\ntion per unit of water applied over an unit area in unit time. Based on the above definition, the concept\\nmade is:\\n“If we provide irrigation facility, the agricultural production and productivity will go up automati-\\ncally”.\\nIrrigation scheduling is a decision-making process repeated many times in each year involving\\nwhen to irrigate and how much of water to apply? Both criteria influence the quantity and quality of the\\ncrop. It indicates how much of irrigation water to be used and how often, it has to be given.\\nExcess irrigation is harmful because:\\n\\x7f it wastes water below root zone\\n\\x7f it results in loss of fertilizers nutrients\\n\\x7f it causes water stagnation and salinity\\n\\x7f it causes poor aeration\\n\\x7f ultimately it damages the crops\\nHowever, irrigation scheduling has its own meaning and importance according to the nature of the\\nwork.\\nFor irrigation engineers  - Irrigation scheduling is important to cover more area with available\\nquantity of water or to satisfy the whole command from head to tail reach in the canal or river system.\\nFor soil scientists - It is important that the field should not be over irrigated or under irrigated as\\nboth will spoil the chemical and physical equilibrium of the soil.\\nFor Agronomists - It is very much important to get higher yield per unit quantity of water in\\nnormal situations and to protect the crop to get as much as possible yield under drought situation by\\nmeans of supplying water in optimum ratio and minimizing all field losses.\\nA. Importance\\nHow much and how often water has to be given de pends on the irrigation requir ement of the crop.\\nIrrigation requirement (IR) = Crop water requirement (CWR)-Effective rainfall (ERF)\\ni.e., IR = WR - ER in mm/day or mm/month.'),\n",

Earlier workers have adopted this practice to work out the duty of water for\\ndifferent crops in many irrigation projects. It is the rough irrigation schedule.

According to the availability of irrigation water, stabilized field channels and\\ngroup-wise irrigation requirement, time schedules are evolved. The irrigation will be done strictly in\\naccordance with the group-wise time schedules by the b lock committees. Within the group, the time is\\nto be shared by the farmers within the group by themselves.\\n11.11 IRRIGATION MANAGEMENT\\n1. Rice - Total water requirement is 1100–1250 mm. The daily consumptive use of rice varies from\\n6-10 mm and total water ranges from 1100–1250 mm depending upon the agro climatic situa-\\ntion. Of the total water required for the crop, 3% or 40 mm is used for the nursery, 16% or\\n200 mm for the land preparation i.e., puddling and 81% or 1000 mm main field irrigation. The\\ngrowth of rice plant in relation to wa ter management can be divided into four periods  viz. ,\\nseedling, vegetative, reproductive and ripening. Less water is consumed during seeding stage. At\\nthe time of transplanting, shallow depth of 2 cm of submergence is necessary to facilitate\\ndevelopment of new roots. The same water level is required for tiller production during the\\nvegetative phase. At the beginning of the maximum tillering stage, the entire water in the field\\ncan be drained and left as such for one or two days which is termed as mid season drainage. This\\nmid season drainage may improve the respiratory functions of the roots, stimulate vigorous\\ngrowth of roots and checks the development of non-effective tillers. Any stress during the\\nvegetative phase may affect the root growth and reduce the leaf area.\\nDuring flowering phase 5 cm submergence should be maintained because it is a critical stage of\\nwater requirement. Stress during this phase will impair all yield components and cause severe\\nreduction in yield. Excess water than 5 cm is also not necessary especially at booting stage,\\nwhich may lead to delay in heading. Water requirement during ripening phase is less and water\\nis not necessary after yellow ripening. Water can be gradually drained from the field 15–21 days\\nahead of harvest of crop. Whenever 5 cm submergence is recommended, the irrigation manage-\\nment may be done by irrigating to 5 cm submergence at saturation or one or two days after the\\ndisappearance of ponded water. This will result in 30% saving of irrigation water compared to\\nthe continuous submergence.\\n2. Groundnut - Total water requirement is 500–550 mm. Evapotranspiration is low during the first\\n35 days after sowing and last 35 days before harvest and reaches a peak requirement between\\npeg penetration and pod development stages. After the sowing irrigation, the second irrigation\\ncan be scheduled 25 days after sowing i.e., 4 or 6 days after first hand hoeing and thereafter\\nirrigation interval of 15 days is maintained up to peak flowering. During the critical stages the\\ninterval may be 7–10 days depending upon the soil and climate. During maturity period, the\\ninterval is 15 days.\\n3. Finger millet - Total water requirement is 350 mm. Finger millet is a drought tolerant crop. Pre-\\nplanting irrigation at 7 and 8 cm is given. Third day after transplanting life irrigation with small\\nquantity of water is sufficient for uniform establishment. Water is then withheld for 10–15 days\\nafter the establishment of seedling for healthy and vigorous growth, subsequently three irrigations\\nare essential at primordial initiation, fl owering and grain filling stages.\\n4. Sugarcane - Total water requirement is 1800–2200 mm. Formative phase (120 days from\\nplanting–germination and tillering phases) is the critical period for water demand. To ensure\\nuniform emergence and optimum number of tillers per unit area, lesser quantity of water at more\\nfrequencies is preferable. The response for applied water is more during this critical phase\\nduring which the crop needs higher quantity of water comparing the other two phases. Water'),\n",

As there is no secondary\\nthickening of stem, elongation of stem as sink for storage of sugar it is desirable to maintain\\noptimum level of moisture during grand growth period. Response for water is less in this stage\\nand this will be still less in the ripening stage. During the ripening phase as harvest time\\napproaches, soil moisture content should be allowed to decrease gradually so that growth of\\ncane is checked and sucrose content is increased.\\n5. Maize - Total water requirement is 500–600 mm. The water requirement of maize is higher but\\nit is very efficient in water use. Growth stag es of maize crop are sowing, four leaf stage, knee\\nhigh, grand growth, tasselling, silking and early dough stages. Crop uniformly requires water in\\nall these stages. Of this, tasselling, silking and early dough stages are critical periods.\\n6. Cotton - Total water requirement is 550–600 mm. Cotton is sensitive to soil moisture conditions.\\nLittle water is used by plant with early part of the season and more is lost through evaporation\\nthan transpiration. As the plant grows, the use of wa ter increases from 3 mm/day and reaching\\na peak of 10 mm a day when the plant is loaded with flowers and bolls. Water used during the\\nemergence and early plant growth is only 10% of the total requirement. Ample moisture during\\nflowering and boll development stages is essential. In the ear ly stages as well as at the end the\\ncrop requires less water. Water requirement  remains high till the boll development stage. If\\nexcess water is given in the stages other than critical stages it encourages the vegetative growth\\nbecause it is a indeterminate plant thereby boll setting may be decreased. Irrigation is continued\\nuntil the first boll of the last flush opens, and then irrigation is stopped.\\n7. Sorghum - Total water requirement is 350–500 mm. The critical periods of water requirement\\nare booting, flowering and dough stages. The crop will be irrigated immediately after sowing.\\nNext irrigation is given 15 days after sowing to encourage development of a strong secondary\\nroot system.

In this juncture, water resources itself become a constraint due to abnormality in\\ndistribution and uncertainty it in the occurrence of rainfall. Hence, at present frequent droughts are very\\ncommon. Under these circumstances, a new water saving strategy has to be adopted in irrigation\\nmanagement and in crop production activities. This part of the chapter discusses about water scarce\\nconditions and the ways to overcome it with some drought alleviating methods.\\nA. Water Scarcity Conditions\\nWater scarcity is the term used for poor storage or non-availability of required quantity of water for the\\npurpose of crop production and otherwise due to failure of monsoons. The scarcity will lead to inadequate\\nsupply of water to the cropped fields,  which in turn create a str ess in plant community. This degree of\\nstress varies depending upon the frequency of irrigation, natur e of the crop, type of soil etc. In this\\nsituation our primary aim is to produce the maximum possible yield per unit quantity of water. The\\nfollowing are some management techniques under stress periods.\\nAssess resource potential - Based on the water potential, optimize the water use by linear\\nprogramming techniques. This type of exercise should be done by the concerned department especially\\nirrigation and agriculture.\\nFarmer’s attitude - Farmer or user’s behaviours need considerable reorientation to enable them to\\nrealize that water is an economic input and conser vation of water is their prime responsibility.\\nImprovement in conveyance structure - A large quantity is lost through conveyance from source\\nto field. It is estimated that about 30-40% of water is lost in conveyance systems. Reducing or totally\\npreventing such losses of water can be made by proper maintenance, lining the channels etc. Conveyance\\nby pipes is often adopted for ground water resource. Such conveyance may be made even at small sluice\\nlevel in command areas.\\nConjunctive use of water - Integrating all water resources with water conservation methods is\\ntermed as conjunctive use. Optimum use of water from different source is the main aim of conjunctive\\nuse. For example, in canal irrigation system the utilization of rainfall and well water optimally to protect\\nthe crop without eroding a single resource of water is termed as conjunctive use of water.\\nContingent plant for rice - Rice is a semi-aquatic plant, which needs submergence of water for its\\nestablishment and better yield. The experimental evidences clearly indicated that 5 cm depth of ponding\\none day after disappearance of previously provided water is superior to higher depths. This was attributed\\nto better aeration and consequently improved root activities.'),\n",

Further investigation\\nreveals that 2 days dry spell in light textured soil and 2– 3 days dry spell in heavy textured soil can be\\nadvocated without much yield reduction. If further scarcity arises, the next management techniques to\\nsave the rice crop is to adopt irrigation at critical stages. Different crop growth stages have different\\nresponse to water stress. In rice crop the most sensitive periods for water stress are active tillering (AT),\\nprimordial initiation (PI), and flowering and milky stages. Dry spell during these periods will drasti-\\ncally reduce the yield.\\nB. Other Management Techniques\\n\\x7f Summer ploughing reduces runoff by increasing the infiltration and thereby reduces water needed\\nfor land preparation.\\n\\x7f Dry nursery with seed hardening technique (1% KCl) can be made which in turn will enhance\\nthe drought tolerance capacity.\\n\\x7f The short duration varieties like ADT 36, IR 36 and IR 50 can be chosen.\\n\\x7f During transplanting, it is enough to irrigate to a depth of 2 cm of water in the field. After that,\\nmaintaining 2.5 cm of water up to 12 days is sufficient.\\n\\x7f Application of herbicide within 3–5 days reduces the weed competition for water which in turn\\nsaves water considerably.\\n\\x7f After 12 days of transplanting, irrigating 5 cm of water one day after the disappearance of\\nponded water can be adopted not only to save water but also to increase the yield to some extent.\\n\\x7f Plastering field bunds and plugging of all crevices, rat and crab holes to avoid water loss through\\nseepage.\\n\\x7f Proper levelling of the field.\\n\\x7f Water should be stopped 10–15 days before harvesting.\\n\\x7f Semidry rice (direct down) saves 30–40% water.\\n\\x7f Application of potassium in 3 split doses as 50% basal 25% at tillering and 25% at panicle\\ninitiation.\\n\\x7f Application of cycocel at the rate of 1000 ppm.\\nC. Drought Alleviating Methods for Irrigated Dry (ID) Crops\\nIn ID crops, the main objective is to irrigate the crops to meet the requirement of ET need of the crops.\\nNormally the ID crops are irrigated at certain intervals and mostly they are cultivated where conjunctive\\nuse of well water is available. So, chances for acute drought are very common on complete failure of\\nmonsoon. In this situation, adopting irrigation at critical stag es save the crops from yield loss. Further,\\nsome drought alleviating chemical spray also protects the crops from severe loss.'),\n",

In\\nhumid regions, these salts are washed down to the ground water and to the sea. But in arid and semi-\\narid regions they accumulate in the soil. Excessive irrigation and poor water management are the two\\nchief causes of water logging and salt accumulation. Accumulation of salts in soil leads to unfavourable\\nsoil-water-air relationship and affect the crop production.\\nA. Causes for Salt Accumulation\\nThe following are the main causes which lead to development of salty soils (Salinity or alkalinity).\\n(i) Arid climate - About 25% of earth surface is arid in which salt accumulation is a common\\nproblem. In India, about 25 m.ha are salt af fected with different degrees of degradation.\\n(ii) High subsoil water table - When the water table is within the capillary range, the water contain-\\ning soluble salts rises to surface. When the water evaporates the salts are deposited as encrusta-\\ntion. It is estimated that in Punjab, annually about 50,000 acres becomes saline because of\\nraising water table.\\n(iii) Poor drainage - Due to poor drainage, accumulation of water leads to water logging condition,\\nwhich leads to salt accumulation.\\nB. Quality of Irrigation Water\\nIrrigation water containing more than permissible quantities of soluble salts with sodium carbonate and\\nbicarbonates make the soil salty.\\nInundation with sea water - In coastal areas, periodical inundation of land by sea water during\\nhigh tides makes soil salty. Besides, deep bore w ells are also the reason for saline soils.\\nNature of parent rock minerals - The saline nature of parent rock minerals leads to salt accumu-\\nlation.\\nSeepage from canals - The continuous seepage leads to salt accumulation.\\nC. Classification of Problem Soils\\nThe soil problems can also be divided into: ( a) Chemical, (b) Physical.\\n(i) Soil chemical problems - The salt affected soils can be classified based on their ESP, pH and\\nEC as follows:\\nESP (%) EC (m.mhos/cm) pH\\nSaline < 15 > 4 < 8.5\\nSaline alkali > 15 > 4 > 8.5\\nAlkali/sodic > 15 < 4 > 8.5'),\n",

The following are the important management practices to overcome these problems.\\n\\x7f The saline soil can be easily improved with leaching of salts by using of good quality water and\\nby providing good drainage system.\\n\\x7f Application of gypsum would improve the permeability of soil by making good soil aggregates.\\n\\x7f In acidic soil, lime application should be adequate and excessive leaching should be avoided.\\n\\x7f Salt resistant or saline resistant species should be selected for cultivation.\\n\\x7f Application of amendments viz., gypsum and press mud is found to suppress the sodium and\\nchromium content in plant and soil.\\n\\x7f Growing resistant crops like ragi, cotton, barley and rice can be advocated.\\n\\x7f Growing green manure crops like sunnhemp,  daincha and kolinji can be advocated.\\n\\x7f Growing resistant varieties like COC 771 in sugarcane and CO 43 in rice may be made.\\n\\x7f Adoption of drip irrigation for possible cr ops is also r ecommended to overcome soil physical\\nand chemical problems.\\n\\x7f Liberal application of FYM.\\n\\x7f Application of green manure.\\n\\x7f Excess phosphorous application.\\n\\x7f Proper drainage to keep the soil without adverse effect to plant system.\\n(ii) Soil physical problems - Fluffy soils, ill drained soils, soils with high infiltration rate, soils with\\nshallow depth and encrustation in soil surface are the possible physical problems. Too frequent irriga-\\ntion in clayey soils with very high water retention results in poor drainage, water logging and crop\\ndamage. Excess irrigation and heavy rain create hardening of soil surface in red lateritic soils with high\\nFe and Al hydroxides and low organic matter. This results in soil crusting. This leads to poor germina-\\ntion, restriction of shoot and root development and slow entry of water into the soil profile.\\nManagement - In light soils, shallow depth of water with more frequency should be adopted. To\\nincrease the infiltration rate in clay soil, amending the soil by mixing with coarse textured soil or tank\\nsilt at the rate of 50 tones per hectare is advocated. Organic wastes like crop residue, farm waste, coir\\npith, filter cake etc., at the rate of 20 tones per hectare once in every year can be applied. Poorly drained\\nclay soils can be improved by providing tile dr ains and trenches intermittently. To make the soil more'),\n",

Quality of Irrigation Water\\nWhatever may be the source of irrigation water  viz., river, canal, tank, open well or tube well, some\\nsoluble salts are always dissolved in it. The main soluble constituents in water are Ca, Mg, Na and K\\nas cations and chloride, sulphate, bicarbonate and carbonate as anions. However, ions of other elements\\nsuch as lithium, silicon, bromine, iodine, copper, cobalt, fluorine, boron, titanium, vanadium, barium,\\narsenic, antimony, beryllium, chromium, manganese, lead, selenium, phosphate and organic matter are\\nalso present. Among the soluble constituents, calcium, sodium,  sulphate, bicarbonate and boron are\\nimportant in determining the quality of irrigation water and its suitability for irrigation purpose. How-\\never, other factors such as soil texture, permeability, drainage, types of crop etc., are equally important\\nin determining the suitability of irrigation water. Following are the most common problems that result\\nform using poor quality water.\\nSalinity - If the total quantity of salts in the irrigation water is high, the salts will accumulate in the\\ncrop root zone and affect the crop growth and yield. Excess salt condition reduces uptake of water due\\nto high concentration of soil solution.\\nPermeability - Some specific salts reduce the rate of infiltration into the soil profile.\\nToxicity - When certain constituents of water are taken up by plants, which accumulate in large\\nquantities and result in toxicity and reduces yield.\\nMiscellaneous - Excessive Nitrogen in irrigation water causes excessive vegetative growth and\\nleads to lodging and delayed crop maturity. White deposits on fruits or leaves may occur due to\\nsprinkler irrigation with high bicarbonate water. Based on the characteristic features of majority of\\nground waters in use by the farmers in different agro-ecological regions of the country, the various\\nindices which describe the nature of hazards on soils and crops, irrigation waters have been broadly\\ngrouped into good, saline and alkali waters. Depending on the degree of restrictions, the too poor\\nquality waters have been further grouped into three homogenous sub groups as given in the Table 11.12.\\nTable 11.12. Groups of Poor Quality Ground Waters for irrigation\\nWater quality Ec (ds/m) SAR (m.mol/L) RSC (me/L)\\nA. Good wa ter < 2 < 10 < 2.5\\nB.

The purpose is to lower the ground water level\\nbelow the root zone of the crop. The movement of water into subsurface drains is influenced by\\nthe hydraulic conductivity of soil, depth of dr ain below ground surface and the horizontal\\ndistance between individual drains.

Mole drainage - Mole drains are unlined circular earthen channels formed within the soil by a\\nmole plough. The mole plough has a long blade like shank to which a cylindrical bullet nosed\\nplug is attached, known as mole. As the plough is drawn through the soil, the mole forms the\\ncavity to a set depth.

Systems of Drainage\\nThere are four systems of drainage:\\n1. Random - This is used where the wet areas are scattered and isolated from each other. The lines\\nare laid more or less at random to drain these wet areas. The main is located in the largest natural\\ndepression while the sub mains and laterals extend to the individual wet areas.\\n2. Herringbone - In this system, the mains are in a narrow depression and the laterals enter the\\nmain from both sides at an angle of 45° like the bones of a fish.\\n3. Gridiron - The gridiron is similar to herringbone b ut the laterals enter the main only from one\\nside at right angels. It is adopted in flat regularly shaped fields. This is an efficient drainage\\nsystem.\\n4. Interceptor - Ditches of differ ent dimensions are constructed at distances to drain the excess\\nwater accumulated on the surface and inside the soil up to the depth of ditch. Such ditches may\\nbe interceptors or relief drains.

It aims at equidistribution of\\nirrigation water irrespective of location of the land in the command area by enforcing irrigation time\\nschedules. Each 10 ha block is divided into 3–4 sub units (irrigation groups). According to the avail-\\nability of irrigation water, stabilized field channels and group-wise irrigation requirement, time sched-\\nules are evolved. The irrigation will be done strictly in accordance with the group-wise time schedules\\nby the block committees. Within the group, the time is to be shared by the farmers within the group by\\nthemselves.\\n11.19 WATER RELATIONS OF SOIL\\nThe mineral and organic compounds of soil from a solid (though not rigid) matrix, the interstices of\\nwhich consists of irregularly shaped pores with a geometry defined by the boundaries of the matrix. The\\npore space, in general, is f illed partly with soil air and liquid vapour and partly with the liquid phase\\nof soil water. Soil moisture is one of the most important ingredients of the soil. It is also one of its most\\ndynamic properties. Water affects intensely many physical and chemical reactions of the soil as well as\\nplant growth. The properties of water can be explained by the structure of its molecule. Two atoms of\\nhydrogen and one atom of oxygen combine to form a mole largely determined by that of the oxygen\\nion. The two hydrogen ions take up practically no space. Water molecules do not exist individually. The\\nhydrogen in the water serves as a connecting link from one molecule to the other. Soil serves as the\\nstorage reservoir for water. Only the water stored in the root zone of a crop can be utilized by it for its\\ntranspiration and buildup of plant tissues. When ample water is in the root zone, plants can obtain their\\ndaily water requirements for proper growth and development. As the plants continue to use water, the\\navailable supply diminishes, and unless more water is added, the plants stop growing and finally die.\\nBefore the stage is reached when crop growth is adversely affected, it is necessary to irrigate again. The\\namount of water to be applied to each irrigation, and the frequency of irrigation are dependent on the\\nproperties of the soil and the crop to be irrigated.\\n11.20 MOVEMENT OF WATER INTO SOILS\\nImmediately after irrigation or rainfall, the first action or process of water intake is called infiltration,\\nthen percolation and then seepage take place. The movement of water from the surface into the soil is\\ncalled infiltration. The infiltration characteristics of the soil are one of the dominant variables influenc-\\ning irrigation. Infiltration rate is the soil characteristic determining the maxim um rate at which water\\ncan enter the soil under specific conditions, including the presence of excess water. It has the dimen-\\nsions of velocity. The actual rate at which water is entering the soil at any given time is termed the\\nInfiltration velocity . The infiltration rate decreases during irrigation. The rate of decrease is rapid\\ninitially and the infiltration rate tends to approach a constant value. The nearly constant rate that\\ndevelops after some time has elapsed from the start of irrigation is called the basic infiltration rate.\\nFactors affecting infiltration rate - The major factors affecting the inf iltration of water into the\\nsoil are the initial moisture content, condition of the soil surface, hydraulic conductivity of the soil\\nprofile, texture, porosity, and degree of swelling of soil colloids and organic matter, vegetative cover,\\nduration of irrigation or rainfall and viscosity of water. The antecedent soil moisture content has con-\\nsiderable influence on the initial rate and total amount of infiltration, both decreasing as the soil\\nmoisture content rises. The infiltration rate of any soil is limited by any restraint to the flow of water'),\n",

The soil layer with the lowest permeability, either at the surface or\\nbelow it, usually determines the infiltration rate. Infiltration rates are also affected by the porosity of the\\nsoil, which is changed by cultivation or compaction. Cultivation influences the infiltration rate by\\nincreasing the porosity of the surface soil and breaking up the surface seals. The effect of tillage on\\ninfiltration usually lasts only until the soil settles back to its former condition of bulk density because\\nof subsequent irrigations.\\nInfiltration rates are generally lower in soils of heavy texture than on soils of light texture. The\\ninfluence of water depth over soil on infiltration ra te was investigated by many workers. It has been\\nestablished that in surface irrigation, increased depth increases initial infiltration slightly but the head\\nhas negligible effect after prolonged irrigation. Infiltration rates are also influenced by the vegetal\\ncover. Infiltration rate on grassland is substantially higher than bare uncultivated land. Additions of\\norganic matter increase infiltration rate substantially. The hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile often\\nchange during infiltra tion, not only because of increasing m oisture content, but also because of the\\npuddling of the surface caused by reorientation of surface particles and washing of finger materials into\\nthe soil. Viscosity of water influences infiltration. The high rate of infiltration in the tropics under\\notherwise comparable soil conditions is due to the low viscosity of warm water.\\n11.20.1 Water Movement in Soil Profile\\nNormally water will move from higher potential to lo wer potential area in soil profile. Generally the\\nwater movement within the soil profile takes place under three conditions.\\n\\x7f Water moves through the water filled pore spaces due to gravity and Hydraulic conductivity or\\nit can also be termed as water movement under saturated condition, i.e., when soil pore spaces\\nare completely filled with water.\\n\\x7f Film of water surrounding the soil particles moves due to the force of surface tension under\\nunsaturated condition or it can be stated as capillary water movement along the potential gradient.\\n\\x7f Water also diffuses as water vapour through the air filled pore spaces along the gradient of\\ndecreasing vapour pressure.\\nWater movement in saturated conditions - Saturated flow occurs when water is in zero or smaller\\ntension or at free water conditions. In this situation, all or most of the pore spaces are completely filled\\nwith water and the water moves downwards due to gravitational force. This saturated flow decreases as\\nthe soil pore space size decreases i.e., the saturated flow is high in coarse textured soil than fine textured\\nsoil. Generally the rate of flow of various texture soils is in the following sequence.\\nSand > loam > clay\\nThe theory of water movement in the soil is based on Darcy’s law or generalized form of Darcy’s\\nlaw.\\nDarcy’s law - It states that the quantity (volume) of water passing through an unit cross-section of\\nsoil is proportional to the gradient of hydraulic head or hydraulic gradient.\\nHydraulic gradient - It is the rate of change in hydraulic head with distance.\\nDifference in hydraulic headHg  . ., \\nDistance\\nhie I\\nd\\n==\\nwhere , Hg = Hydraulic gradient = I'),\n",

In this condition the macro\\npores are filled with air and only micro pores are filled with water which is held relatively more tightly\\nand water is able to move very slowly. When soil moisture decreases, a part of pore spaces is occupied\\nby soil air and the cross-sectional area for water movement is reduced and three by hydraulic conduc-\\ntivity becomes low. In unsaturated conditions, the conductivity is more in fine soil than coarse textured\\nsoil. Hence, the unsaturated hydraulic conducti vity is the function of soil moistur e content, number,\\nsize and continuity of soil pores etc. The rate of unsaturated flow in various soil texture is in the\\nfollowing order.\\nSand < loam < clay\\n11.21 WATER VAPOUR MOVEMENT\\nIt takes place within the soil as well as between soil and atmosphere under dry range. The vaporization\\nunder wet range is not taken into account in irrigation practices as it is in negligible range. The finer the\\nsoil pores higher is the moisture tension under which maximum water vapour occurs. In the coarse\\ntextured soil, at low tension the soil pores become free of liquid water when soil dries out. There is little\\nmoisture left for vapour transfer. But fine textured soil retains substantial amount of moisture even at\\nhigh tensions thus permitting vapour movement in soil occurs before it reaches PWP (Permanent\\nWilting Point). In this situation water vapour movement contribution is considered for the survival of\\nplants. Distribution of water in sandy loam and clay loam type of soil is given in figure.

At this stage, all the micro and macro pores are filled with\\nwater. This condition is said to be the saturation point or maximum water holding capacity of soil. In\\nsaturation point, water is held without any force or tension or the tension is almost zero. This is equal\\nto free water surface. At this point, the gravitational  force tends to pull some water or part of water,\\nwhich moves downwards due to gravitational force. This water is known as gravitational water or free\\nwater.\\n11.22.2 Field Capacity\\nThis can be defined as the moisture content present in the soil after the drainage of water due to\\ngravitational force is stopped or ceased or become very slow. Hence, it can also be stated as the\\nmoisture content retained against the gravitational force. It can also be defined as the moisture present\\nin the micro pore or capillary pore, which cannot be drained off due to gravity. At this point, the\\nmoisture content in the soil is comparatively stable and each soil particle is completely surrounded with\\nthick film of water. Hence, it is also known as capillary water. This soil moisture is held with some force\\nor tension against the gravitational force. The force with which water is held is measured in terms of\\nmoisture tension. Normally it ranges from 1/10 atmosphere to 1/3 atmosphere for coarse and fine\\ntextured soils, respectively.\\nThe field capacity is the upper limit of available water to plants or maximum water available point\\nto the plants. Hence, it is also known as Full point. T he field capacity of soil is influenced by the soil\\ntexture or size of the particles,  structure and amount of wa ter applied. Immediately after irrigation or\\nrainfall soil will reach saturation and its f ield capacity after two or three days depending upon the soil\\ntexture. The time required to reach field capacity condition is increased if soils are fine textured and rich\\nin organic matter, which restricts the downward movement of water.\\n11.22.3 Permanent Wilting Point\\nIt is the condition of soil moisture at which plant cannot extract water from soil due to its high tension.\\nIt is the soil moisture condition at which water is held so tightly by the soil particles and this water\\ncannot be removed by the plant roots. The plants wilting cannot be changed by further addition of water\\n(or) the plant cannot regain its turgidity even though water is made available to the plants. This condi-\\ntion is called permanent wilting point. At this point, soil moistur e tension will reach very high i.e., the\\nmoisture held in soil particles with a tension of about 14 to 15 atmospheres.

Some highly drought resistant crops will not wilt but\\nshow the symptoms like stunted plant growth, drooping of leaves, change in appearance and leaf colour,\\ndrooping of flowers, fruits etc.\\n11.22.4 Available Soil Moisture\\nThis is the moisture content between the FC and the PWP level.

Water holding capacity - Water holding capacity is estimated with Keen and Razowaski cup.\\nThe soil is paced in this cup after fitting a filter pa per at the bottom. Soil is soaked by capillary\\naction. Weight is taken immediately after wiping the water on the sides of the cup and moisture\\nis computed on oven dry basis.\\n2. Field capacity - Field capacity is estimated directly in the field by ponding water in the plot\\ncovered all round by a bund. The test area may be 2 m2. After a copious rain or heavy irrigation,\\nestimation may be taken up. Soil is allowed to drain the excess water. Surface is covered to\\nprevent evaporation. This may be accomplished by spreading a polythene sheet or thick straw\\nmulch on the ground surface. Soil sampling is to be done at 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours. Soil\\nmoisture content is estimated by gravimetric method after drying in an oven at 105°C for\\n6–9 hours till concordant weights are obtained. Moisture curves ar e to be drawn to locate the\\nrelatively stable values against time. For all soils except heavy clay soil, the sampling time may\\nbe 48 hours from irrigation. For experimental fields, field capacity ma y be estimated for few\\nlayers (0–15, 16–30, 30–45 and 45–60 cm) depending upon the rooting depth and information\\nto be generated. Field capacity is also estimated with pressure plate apparatus by maintaining\\n1/3 atmosphere in disturbed soil sample.\\n3. Moisture equivalent - Moisture equivalent is estimated in the disturbed and air- dried soil\\nsample. The soil is passed through 2.0 mm sieve. A porcelain buchner funnel of 5 × 2 cm is\\ntaken. A filter paper is slightly wet to enable to stick on the bottom. Air-dry soil is added to the\\nfunnel with gentle tapping against a smooth surface to ensure uniform packing. Soil is added to\\nthe full capacity of the buckner funnel and cut of the surface with the spatula. Soil sample in the\\nfunnel is left into water to enable the water to move by capillary action through the stem of the\\nfunnel. Soil in the funnel is left for 24 hours to be in equilibrium with water through capillary\\nmovement. After 24 hours, the funnel is removed from water column and fitted to a filter flask.\\nThe filter flask is connected to a vacuum pump (550 rpm) and subjected to suction for 15\\nminutes. During the process of suction, the soil is put into an aluminum cup without filter paper\\nand moisture content is estimated by oven dry method.\\n4. Wilting point - Estimation of wilting point moisture involves growing of sunflower as indicator\\nplant in tin can. The tin can is closed with lid and the plant is allowed to grow through an\\nopening in the lid. The plant is watered to grow for three to four weeks till three to four leaves\\ndevelop. The plant is watered last and the space in the lid around the stem of the plant is plugged\\nwith cotton to control evaporation. The plant in the tin is allowed to wilt gradually. When the\\nplant shows signs of loss of turgor, the can with plant is transferred to a dark humid cabinet to\\ncreate high humidity. To reduce transpiration the humid cabinet is co vered with a black poly-\\nthene sheet. Inner sides of the cabinet are lined with gunny to retain moisture. The plant is\\nallowed to extract moisture form the soil. If the plant is gaining turgidity, it is exposed to\\natmosphere for two hours and then transferred to humid cabinet. This process is repeated till the\\nplant does not recover in the humid cabinet. At the stage  the moisture content of the soil in the\\ncan is estimated to find out the wilting point of the soil.\\n5. Use of pressure plate apparatus for estimating soil moisture constants - Soil moisture con-\\ntent values may be obtained by the use of pressure plate apparatus or pressure membrane appa-\\nratus.

The method and quantity of water absorp-\\ntion varies with crops and their rooting pattern. The moist ure extraction pattern revels about how the\\nmoisture is extracted and how much quantity is extracted at different depth level in the root zone. The\\nmoisture extraction pattern shows the relative amount of moisture extracted from different depths\\nwithin the crop root zone. The moisture e xtraction pattern of plant growing in a uniform soil without\\na restrictive layer and with adequate supply of available soil moisture throughout the zone is shown in\\nFigure. It is seen from the following figure that about 40% of the total moisture is extracted from the\\nfirst quarter of the root z one, 30% from second quarter, 20% from the third quarter and 10% from last\\nfourth quarter. This indicates that in most of the crops the effective root zone will be available in the 1st\\nquarter and it does not mean that the last quarter will not need any water. Hence, soil moisture\\nmeasurements at different depths in the root zone have to be taken.\\n\\x7f to estimate the soil moisture status, and\\n\\x7f to work out the irrigation quantity to be applied.\\nA. Rooting Characteristics and Moisture Extraction Pattern\\nThe root system is extremely variable in different crop plants. The variability exists in rooting depth,\\nroot length and horizontal distribution of roots. These are further influenced by environmental factors\\nand the genetic constitution. The roots of cereals apparently occupy more surface area of the soil than\\nother crops. For example, it has been proved that cereals’ roots extend to 200–400 cm of soil surface\\narea as against 15–200 cm/m 2 for most graminaceous plants. The amount of soil moisture that is\\navailable to the plant is determined by the moisture characteristics of the soil depth and the density of\\nthe roots. The moisture characteristics of soil like FC and PWP cannot be altered so easily and greater\\npossibilities lie in changing the rooting characteristics of plants system to go deeper and denser and\\nmore proliferation to tap water from deeper layer of soil as well as from the larger surface area. Plants\\nvary genetically in their rooting characteristics.

Mechanism of Water Absorption\\nIn plants, water is absorbed through root hairs, which are in contact with soil water. The wall of the root\\nhairs are permeable and consists of pectic and cellulose substances which are strongly hydrophilic\\n(water loving) in nature. There are two types of absorption  viz., (a) Active absorption, and (b) Passive\\nabsorption.\\n(a) Active absorption - Here the process of osmosis plays an important role. The soil plant water\\nmovement can be effected due to forces of imbibition, diffusion and osmosis.\\nSignificance of Osmosis\\n\\x7f Large quantities of water are absorbed by roots from soil by osmosis.\\n\\x7f Cell to cell movement of water and other substances takes place through this process.\\n\\x7f Opening and closing of stomata depends upon the turgor pressure of guard cells.\\n\\x7f Due to osmosis the turgidity is maintained and give a shape to the plants.\\n(b) Passive absorption - It is mainly due to transpiration and the r oot cells do not play active role.\\nPassive absorption takes place when rate of transpir ation is very high. Rapid evaporation from the\\nleaves during transpiration creates a tension in water in the xylem of the leaves. These tension is\\ntransmitted to the water in xylem of roots through the xylem of stem. Due to this, water rises upward\\nto reach the transpiring surface. As a result, soil water enters into the cortical cells through the root hairs\\nto reach xylem of the roots to maintain the supply of water . The force for this entry of water is created\\nin leaves due to rapid transpiration and hence the r oot cells remain passive during this process. It is\\notherwise known as transpiration pull.\\nB. Factors Affecting Absorption of Water\\n(i) Available soil water - Capillary water is available to plants. Hygroscopic water and gravitational\\nwater are not available to plants. The capillar y water is absorbed by the plants, which in turn\\nreduces the soil water potential. Hence, the water from higher potential area tends to move to\\nlower potential area and root will absorb this water. This is the chain of process involved in water\\nuptake.\\n(ii) Concentration of soil solutions - High concentration affects the process of osmosis.\\n(iii) Soil air - Sufficient amount of O2 should be there and excess amount of CO2 affects the availability\\nof water by root suffocation.\\n(iv) Soil temperature - Up to 30oC favours absorption. V ery low and very high temperature affects\\nabsorption.\\n(v) Soil texture\\nClay – Neither good nor bad\\nSand – Not good for absorption\\nLoamy – Good for absorption\\nC.

Certain critical\\nstages at which if there is shor tage of moisture, yield is reduced drastically. When there is shortage of\\nwater, it is better to take care of the critical stages first to obtain increased water use efficiency.\\n(i) Water and fertilizer - Water is the key factor in all the three mechanisms (mass flow, diffusion,\\ntranspiration pull) of nutrient uptake. Root interce pts more nutrient ions wh en growing in a\\nmoist soil than dry soil. In moist soil, the effectiv e root zone area will be more and extensive\\nwhich in turn absorbs more water and nutrients. This is especially important for calcium and\\nmagnesium. If the applied fertilizer uptake is mo re, it enhances the growth and increases the\\nyield under irrigated condition than dry condition whic h in turn increases the water use effi-\\nciency. Hence, it is concluded that there is a close relationship between soil moisture and nutri-\\nent uptake by plants. The application of fertilizer or nutrients without adequate moisture in root\\nzone is not useful to plants. Similarly, mutual benefits are also obtained from fertilizer. For e.g.,\\nin drought situation balanced fertilized crops is ab le to withstand drought, than relatively low\\nfertilized crop. Even well balanced fertilized crop may not show its normal growth and\\ndevelopment unless adequate moisture is available. This is not only due to poor uptake, but also\\ndue to poor ET and which in turn reducing the use of absorbed nutrients for photosynthesis.\\n(ii) Fertilizer use efficiency can be increased by :\\n\\x7f Soil test to evaluate nutrient deficienc y and use of proper quantity of the needed fertilizer.\\nApplying fertilizer based on soil test values.\\n\\x7f Placement of fertilizers rather than broadcasting.\\n\\x7f Split does of application at suitable time interval rather than bulk application.\\n\\x7f Controlled application of water to avoid leaching of fertilizers to deeper layers.\\nIn most cases there is significant correlation between soil moisture regime, fertilizer requirement\\nand the availability of fertilizer for plant use.\\n(a) Nitrogen - Mineralization of nitrogen increases as the water content of soil increases from PWP\\nto FC and to saturation. When the fer tilizer is applied to the surf ace soil, its uptake is inhibited\\nwhen the soil dries.\\n(b) Phosphorus - Increase in soil moisture to an optimum leve l is generally possible because of\\nreduced aeration and root penetration or the increased activity of sesqioxide fraction on ‘P’\\nfixation under reduced condition. In dry areas ‘P’ applied close to the seed is more effective than\\nthe broadcast application. The availability and uptake of P is less in dry or rain fed condition.\\n(c) Potassium - Soil moisture content affects the level of exchangeable ‘K’ in the soil. In high soil\\nmoisture zone, availability of k is increased. The results of studies on fertilizer-irrigation rela-\\ntionship lead to the following conclusions.\\n\\x7f Water use efficiency is raised by fertilizers by increased DMP (DRY matter production) and\\nyield\\n\\x7f The response of fertilizer is generally of a higher order under irrigated condition than under\\nunirrigated condition.\\nResponse to frequent irrigation is generally enhanced by  increased levels of fertilizer application,\\nparticularly crops grown for its vegetative plant parts.'),\n",

Thus, the internal\\nwater balance or degree of turgidity of a plant depends on the relative rates of water absorption and\\nwater loss, and is affected by the complex of atmospheric, soil and plant factors that modify the rates\\nof absorption and transpiration. Water moves in response to a potential gradient. When the plant roots\\nare in equilibrium with the soil water potential and the soil water potential gradients are near zero, a\\nbase level of leaf turgor or plant water potential is reached. Under the conditions of low evaporative\\ndemand during the night and early morning (Prior to sunrise) the values of water potential are often or\\nnear this level. An increase in the rate of transpiration coincident with the increase in evaporation,\\nduring the day, causes a decrease in the turgor pr essure of the upper leaves and the development of\\nwater potential gradients through the plant from the evaporating surface of the leaves to the absorbing\\nsurface of the roots. Conditions are of such that the rate of water loss exceeds the rate of water\\nabsorption, causing an internal water deficit to develop in the plant. It is the internal water deficit,\\nthrough its influence on many of the physiological processes in the plant that is directly responsible for\\nthe growth and yield of a crop under the prevailing conditions. The yield of crop is the integrated result\\nof a number of physiological processes. Water str ess can affect photosynthesis and respiration. It can\\nalso affect growth and reproduction. Reduction in leaf area, cell size and inter-cellular volume are\\ncommon under water stress. Dehydration of protoplasm may be responsible for decreasing several\\nphysiological processes. Water stress at certain critical stages of plant growth causes more injury than\\nat other stages. For example, irrigation at the crown root initiation stage has been shown to be essential\\nfor increased yield of wheat crop.'),\n",

Short duration varieties that avoid extensive\\ndrought period may be better drought resistant than other varieties. Researches on producing idiotype\\nplants with leaf and stomatal characteristics suitable for drought resistance may result in developing\\nsuitable drought resistant varieties. Plants exhibit drought tolerance either because the plants are able\\nto survive tissue desiccation. Drought-hardy plants usually have smaller cells than those living in moist\\nhabits. When desiccated, small cells undergo a much smaller proportionate reduction in volume than do\\nlarge cells and therefore do not suffer large disturbances as the latter. In general, increased osmotic\\nvalues are the characteristics of plants ha ving superior drought hardiness. The higher osmotic values\\nnot only increases the ability of cells to retain water, but may also have an additional effect by increasing\\nthe resistance of the protoplasm to dehydration. One of the most effective safeguards against drought\\ninjury is a deep and wide-spreading root system as that of sorghum. Plants with shallow, sparsely\\nbranched root systems like potatoes, onions etc. Suffer sooner than deep-rooted species like Lucerne\\nand maize.'),\n",

Besides the genetic factors, the\\nenvironmental factors grouped as climatic factors and soil factors influence plant growth. The supply\\nof mineral nutrient elements to the plants is discussed in this chapter. A complete analysis of plants\\ndetects large number of elements. But only certain elements are essential. An element is said to be\\nessential if the plant cannot complete its life cycle without it, and if the malady (deficiency) that\\ndevelops in plants in its absence can be remedied onl y by that element.\\nEarlier 16 elements were considered as essential for plant gr owth. They are carbon, hydrogen,\\noxygen, nitrogen phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulphur, iron, manganese, zinc, copper,\\nmolybdenum, boron and chlorine. Recently, sodium, cobalt, vanadium, silicon, selenium, gallium,\\naluminium and iodine are added to the above list. One or the other of these elements (recently added)\\nhas been found to be essential for a particular group or species of plants. Carbon dioxide, water and\\nmolecular oxygen are the forms in which C, H and O are assimilated by plants. Others are taken up by\\nplants from the soil. Nutrient uptake by plants accounts for about  10 percent of total dry weight of\\ncrops, the remaining percentage being water. The chemical  symbol and the ionic forms in which the\\nessential elements are absorbed by the plants are given in Table 12.1.\\nTable  12.1.

These nutrients are added to the soil by external sources to maintain soil\\nfertility and sustainable production. Manure is the or ganic material derived form animal, human and\\nplant residues, which contains plant nutrients in complex organic forms.

Of these two sources, most widely used all over the\\nworld, one is organic in nature–the organic manures simply called manures and the other comprises the\\nsynthetic or naturally occurring chemical fertilizers simply called fertilizers.\\n12.4  ORGANIC MANURES\\nOrganic manures include plant and animal by-products such as oil cakes fish manures and dried blood\\nfrom slaughter houses. Before their organic nitrogen used by the crops it is converted through bacterial\\naction into readily usable ammonical N and nitrate N. These manures are therefore, relatively slow\\nacting, but they supply available N for a longer period.\\nAdvantages - Organic manures supply plant nutrients inc luding micronutrients. Organic manures\\nimprove physical properties of the soil, water holding capacity, hydraulic conductivity, infiltration\\ncapacity of the soil. CO 2 released during decomposition combines with water and forms carbonic acid\\nand act as CO2 fertilizer. Organic manures supply energy (food) for microbes and increase availability\\nof nutrients and improve soil fertility . Green manures have the additi onal advantage of fixing atmos-\\npheric nitrogen leading to nitrogen economy in crop production and green manures draw nutrients from\\nlower layers and concentrate them in the surface soil for the use of succeeding crop.\\nClassification\\nA.

Example: Farm yard manure, compost, sewage and sludge\\netc.\\nA. Farm Yard Manure (FYM)\\nIt is the manure produced in the farm which is made up of excreta (dung and urine) of farm animals,\\nthe bedding materials provided for them and miscellaneous farm and house hold wastes. Straw, peat and\\nsaw dust, dry leaves etc., are used as bedding material for farm animal and accounts to 3–4 kg per\\nanimal per day. The bedding material is called ‘litter’ and it absorbs urine voided by animals. It is not\\na standardized product and its value depends on the kind of feed fed to the animal, the amount of straw\\nused and the manner of storage. In general FYM contains 0.8% N, 0.41% P 2O5 and 0.74% K 2O. The\\nexcreta of horses and sheep are drier than other and do not get compacted in the heap. There is\\nconsiderable aeration, bacterial activity and rise in temperature in the manure. They are therefore called\\n‘hot manures’ in the temperate countries. Pig and cattle manure contain more moisture and compacted\\nin the manure pit. Their decomposition is not as vigorous as that of hot manures and the rise of\\ntemperature is also low. Therefore pig and cattle manures are called “ cold manures”. The decomposi-\\ntion of cattle manures may be slo wer comparatively under temperate regions but it is rapid enough\\nunder tropical condition.\\nB. Compost\\nIt is a manure derived from decomposed plant residues usually made by fermenting waste plant mate-\\nrials heaped or put in a pit usually in alternate layers with a view to bring the plant nutrients in a more\\nreadily available form.\\nSuper compost: Compost fortified with super phosphate is called as super compost. Starters are the\\nmaterials added to the composting organic wastes, which provide the decomposing organism. Pig dung\\nslurry is a valuable starter and provides necessary organisms. Even cow dung slurry can be used as\\nstarter. Generally ammonium sulphate and super phosphate are added to the layers at the time of\\nfurrowing the composting heap to enrich nitrogen and phosphorus status of compost respectively.\\nFertilizers accelerate and hasten the decomposition of organic matter or wastes.\\nC. Sewage and Sludge\\nIn cities human excreta are flushed out with large quantities of water, which is known as sludge. It\\ncontains two components, one is solid portion called sludge and another is liquid portion called sewage\\nwater. In general, the sludges are rich in N and P, and low in K. The sewage water is used for irrigation\\nafter proper treatments.\\nTable 12.3.

Usually the fertility status of sodic soil is very poor because of its high pH and\\nexchangeable sodium percentage. The soil organic matter content, a measure of available nitrogen, is\\nvery low i.e., 0.1-0.5% in sodic soil because sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate salts in solution\\ndissolve the humus. Further the available nitrogen is much lower in the subsoil layers of the sodic soils.\\nReclamation of alkali soils basically involves replacing Na on the exchange complex with more\\nfavourable cations. The solubility of lime, which is always present in alkali soils in significant amounts,\\nis very low, because the potassium content of alkali soil is high. There is an intimate relationship\\nbetween soil pH, partial pressure of CO2 and calcium ion activity in calcareous alkali soils. Increase in\\nCO2 production in the soil enables to increase the sol uble Ca status of soils. This in turn, replaces\\nexchangeable Na, resulting in the improvement of alkali soils. Soil incorporation of easily decompos-\\nable plant material results in increased and rapid production of CO 2. For this reason, green manuring\\nhas been suggested as an important management practice for the reclamation of alkali soils.\\nSesbania aculeata and Delonix elata  are very effective green manures and green leaf manures\\nrespectively used for reclamation of sodic soils. Daincha (Sesbania aculeata) is highly resistant to both\\ndrought and water stagnation and salinity and alkalinity. It can be grown in soils with pH 4.5 to 9.5. It\\nproduces green matter of 20 t/ha in 90 days. Daincha contains 3.2% N and 34% Ca on dry weight basis\\nwhich helps to replace Na from sodic soils. The acid juice (pH 4.0) and high seed protein content (58%)\\nseems to be the cause of its resistance to sodicity stress. During the reclamation of sodic soils gypsum\\n@ 50% of gypsum requirement (GR)  has to be spread uniformly over the field. The surface soil is to\\nbe ploughed to mix the gypsum in the sodic soil. Irrigate the field with 10-15 cm depth of water and\\nmaintain the same water depth for 3-4 days. At this stage, the sodium content in clay particles are'),\n",

Atmospheric nitrogen is fixed effectively by the microorganisms either in\\nsymbiotic association with plant system (Rhizobium, Azolla) or in associative symbiosis (Azospirillum)\\nor in free living system (Azotobactor, phosphobacterium, blue green algae) or in micorhizal symbiosis\\n(VAM fungi).\\n(a) Rhizobium - Rhizobium bacteria can fix a tmospheric nitrogen symbiotically. They live in the\\nnodules of host plants belonging to the f amily leguminoceae. The quantities of nitrogen fixed by\\nRhizobia differ with the rhizobial strain, the ho st plant and the environmental conditions under which\\nthe two develop. The species of the genus Rhizobium are numerous and require certain host plants. For\\nexample, the bacteria that live symbiotically with soybean will not do so with alfalfa. A list of common\\nlegumes and the rhizobial strains by which they are inoculated is given in the Table 12.11.\\nTable 12.11. Classification of Rhizobium–Legume Associations\\nRhizobium species Legumes\\n1. Rhizobium meliloti Alfalfa (Lucerne)\\n2. R. trifolii Clover\\n3. R. leguminosarum Peas\\n4. R. phaseoli Beans\\n5. R. lupine Lupine\\n6. R. japonicum Soybean \\n7. Rhizobium sp. Cowpea \\nFixation of nitrogen by the leguminous plants will be at maximum only when the level of available\\nsoil nitrogen is at the minimum. It is sometimes advisable to include a small amount of nitrogen in the\\nfertilizer of legume crops at sowing time (as a starter dose) to ensure that the young seeding will have\\nan adequate supply until the rhizobia can become established. Larger quantity of nitrogen or continued\\napplications of nitrogen, however reduce the activity of the rhizobia and therefore they are generally'),\n",

Rhizobial inoculation was found to fix 15-35 kg N per ha in a season on different pulse\\ncrops. Rhizobial inoculation can save up to 25% N fertilizer application to crops.\\n(b) Azolla - It is a small water fern of worldwide distribution under natural conditions. It contains\\nthe heterocystous blue green algae Anabaena azollae as a symbiont in an enclosed chamber in the\\ndorsal leaf lobes. Azolla derives all its total nitrogen requirement by the symbiotic association with the\\nalgae. The Azolla–Anabaena system is agronomically most signification plant algal association and this\\nis being employed as a nitrogen source for rice culture. There are six species of Azolla. They are Azolla\\ncaroliniana, Azolla filiculoides, Azolla mexicana, Azolla nilotica, Azolla microphylla and Azolla pinnata.\\nAzolla contains 3.1-4.2% N; 0.16% P 2O5 and 0.18% K 2O on dry weight basis.\\n(c) Azospirillum - This bacterium is associated with cereals like rice, sorghum, maize, cumbu, ragi,\\ntenai and other minor millets and also for cotton, sugarcane, oilseeds and fodder grasses. These bacteria\\ncolonizing in the roots not only remain on the root surface, but also a sizable proportion of them\\npenetrates into the root tissues and lives in harmony with the plants. They do not, however, produce any\\nvisible nodules or out growth on the root tissue. In the absence of any plant, azospirillum live in the soil\\njust like any other micro organism saprophytically, however, when a suitable crop is raised, they are\\nattracted towards the root system, where the y colonize and grow in almost a symbiotic manner.\\n(d) Azatobacter - The beneficial effects of Azatobacter on plants was associated (non-symbiotically)\\nnot only with the process of nitrogen fixation but also with the synthesis of complex of biologically\\nactive compounds such as nicotinic acid, pyridoxine, biotin, gibberellins and probably other com-\\npounds which stimulate the germination of seeds and accelerate plant growth. Azatobacter population\\nin soil or near the root zone of crops (Rhizosphere) is very low when compared to other soil bacteria.\\nThe nitrogen fixation potential of this bacterium is also not very high and appreciable (20 to 30 kg of\\nN per ha per year). A fairly high population is required for substantial nitrog en fixation. Enormous\\nenergy is required by Azatobacter for nitrogen f ixation. The possible source of energy for Azatobacter\\nis the soil organic matter. The energy generated during the utilization of organic matter is used for\\nnitrogen fixation.\\n(e) Blue green algae - The blue green algae occur under a wide range of environmental conditions.\\nThey are completely auto tropic and requir e light, water, free nitrogen (N2), carbon dioxide (CO2) and\\nsalts containing the essential mineral elements. They play a major role in the nitrogen economy of\\npaddy soils in tropical countries.

It is essential to use the\\nphosphobacteria (a free living bacteria in soils like Bacillus megatherium) for proper solubilisation of\\nfixed P and release them in the available form for the crop to take-up for its growth. Dual inoculation\\nof the phosphobacteria with rhizobium or azospirillum can provide both N and P to the crop.'),\n",

The\\nmycorhizal symbiosis is an intimate association between plant root system and certain group of soil\\nfungi. The plant provides carbon as energy source to the fungus which in turn helps the plant in better\\nuptake of nutrients (especially P). The V AM fungi form either a mantle of hyphae around the root or\\npenetrate inside the roots spreading intra or intercellularly in the cortical region. The fungal mycelium\\nalso extends several centimeter, away from the root in the soil. The area that the plant can explore for\\nnutrients thus greatly increase due to colonization of plant roots by the mycorrhizal fungi. The\\ndevelopment of mycorrhiza network is much more in soils with low fertility. In nutrient rich soils, there\\nis very little extension of mycelial network. T he mycelial growth is confined to the close proximity of\\nroots. Mycorrhiza increases crop yield, protect against certain root pathogen, helps in uptake of P, Cu,\\nZn and B and increases tolerance to environmental stress.\\n12.7 FACTORS AFFECTING MANURES AND FERTILIZERS USE\\nMajor factors influencing the selection, quantity, time and method of application of manures and\\nfertilizers are:\\nSoil factors - They most important factors are, soil physical condition (texture), soil fertility and\\nsoil reaction.\\n\\x7f Poor physical condition of the soil leads to poor plant growth due to impeded drainage, restricted\\naeration and unfavourable soil temperature. In this condition nutrients will not be used efficiency.\\n\\x7f Optimum soil moisture re gime is essential for efficient use of fertilizers by crops.\\n\\x7f The availability of nutrients is poor in coarse text ured soil when compared to fine textured soils.\\nThe coarse textured soil needs more frequent application of fertilizers when compared to heavy\\ntextured soil.\\n\\x7f The higher the fertility of soil, the low er is the response to manures and fertilizers.\\n\\x7f When the organic matter of the soil is higher, the response to fertilizer by crops is more.\\n\\x7f Soil reaction is important for selection of right type of fertilizers Rock Phosphate is advanta-\\ngeous in acid soils.\\nCrop factors\\n\\x7f The response of crop to fertiliz ers varies with the nature of crop and variety of the crop.\\n\\x7f The fertilizer responsiveness of a plant depends on the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the\\nroots. The root CEC of dicotyledonous plants is much higher than that of monocotyledonous\\nplants. Plants with higher CEC absorb more of dival ent cations (Ca, M g) whereas plants with\\nlow CEC absorb more of monovalent ions (K, Na).\\n\\x7f The ability of the crop to absorb nutrients from the soil depends upon the size of the root system\\n(root length and spread) and character istics like root surface and root hair density etc. Large\\nramifying root system absorbs more nutrients.\\n\\x7f The association of mycorrhizal fungi with the roots of plants grown under conditions of low soil\\nfertility, increases the ability of plants to absorb nutrients such as P, K, Cu and Zn. Normally N,\\nP and complete fertilizer application reduce the presence and activity of Mycorrhiza.\\nAgronomic factors - Fertilizer responsiveness of crops depends on timely sowing, proper spacing,\\nproper dose, time and method of fertilizer application.'),\n",

All these can serve as an important supplementary source of nutrients\\nalong with the chemical fertilizers. Thus, INM is environmentally non-degradable, technically appro-\\npriate economically viable and socially acceptable.\\nBalanced nutrition for sustainable crop production\\nThe rate of growth of agriculture in its broad coverage of crop production is much below the national\\ngrowth rate. If the economy of country is to be improved through agriculture, it has to strengthen its\\nprogrammes in such a manner to better utilize the natural resources along with balanced use of chemi-\\ncal fertilizers and other inputs. For increasing the food production to fulfill the food requirements of the\\nburgeoning population of the country, sustainability of ag riculture and environmental safety are the\\npriority issues. To avoid wastage of precious national resources and to minimize the environmental\\ndamage, there is need to develop and demonstrate balanced use of chemical fertilizer. This will not only\\nimprove the crop production in sustainable way but also economize the crop production. Higher food\\nproduction needs higher amount of plant nutrients. As no single source is capable of supplying the\\nrequired amount of nutrients, inte grated use of all sources is a must to supply balanced nutrition to\\nplants.\\nWhat is balanced nutrition?\\nBalanced fertilization does not mean a certain definite proportion of N, P and K or other nutrients to be\\nadded in the form of fertilizer, but it has to taken into account the availability of nutrients already\\npresent in the soil, crop requirement and other factors lik e crop removal of nutrients, the economics of\\nfertilizers and profitability, farmers ability to invest, agro-techniques, soil moisture regime, weed control,\\nplant protection, seed rate, sowing time, soil salinity, alkalinity, physical environment, microbiological\\ncondition of the soil, available nutrient status of soil, cropping sequence, etc. It is not a state but a\\ndynamic concept. The balanced use of fertilizers should be mainly aimed at: ( a) increasing crop yield,\\n(b) increasing crop quality, (c) increasing farm income, (d) correction of inherent soil nutrient deficiencies,\\n(e) maintaining or improving lasting soil fertility, ( f) avoiding damage to the environment, and\\n(g) restoring fertility and productivity of the land that has been degraded by wrong and exploitative\\nactivities in the past. Balanced use of plant nutrients corrects nutrient deficiency, improves soil fertility,\\nincreases nutrient and water use efficiency, enhances crop yields and fa rmer’s income, improves crop\\nand environmental quality. To reap the benefits of balanced use of plant nutrients, it is important to have\\ngood quality seed, adequate moisture and better agronomic practices with greater emphasis on timeliness\\nand precision in farm operations.\\nSoil testing is one of the most important tools to practice balanced fertilization. Balanced fertilizer\\nrates differ from area to area and also from crop to crop. Through soil testing, farmers can know how\\nmuch and what kind of fertilizer to use for each crop. A further refinement in fertilizer dose is possible'),\n",

Crop production\\nunder intensified agriculture over the years has resulted in large scale removal of nutrients from the soil,\\nresulting in negative balance and declining soil fertility. Organic sources are undoubtedly an important\\nsource of nutrients but their amounts and available nutrient content and the release rate is woefully\\ninadequate for meeting the demands of intensive and high yielding crop production. India is presently\\nusing 15 m.t. of nutrients in the form of c hemical fertilizers. Supplying the same through organic\\nsources would require mor e than a thousand m.t., which is an impossible task indeed. Such organic\\nmanures in monumental volumes are neither available nor can be generated. Thus organic sources of\\nnutrients can only be relied upon on meeting parts of the nutrients needs of the crop. They should be\\nadded along with chemical fertilizers for ensuring stability and sustainability of food production. In\\nIndia, fertilizer consumption increased from less than 50,000 t in 1950 to 15 m.t. in 2000 and the food\\ngrain production increased from 50 m.t. to 200 mt in the same period, indicating a direct relationship\\nbetween the fertilizer use and yield increase. The green revolution or spectacular increase in production\\nwould not have been possible without many fold increase in use of fertilizers. The high yielding\\nvarieties became a catalyst for the conversion of chemical energy into biological productivity. The full\\npotential of these varieties were not yet realized. Even the optimum potential of available technology\\nremains mostly unrealized in most regions as nutrient input does not match the needs of the crop and\\nsoil.\\nThere are vast differences in consumption of fertilizers per ha of cropped area in different regions.\\nThe fertilizer consumption varies from 114, 103, 58, 47 kg (NPK) per ha cropped area in north, south,\\neast and west respectively. Some states like Punja b are using more than 167 kg nutrients per ha as\\nagainst some using less than 10 kg nutrients per ha. About 70–80 per cent fertilizer is used for growing\\nrice and wheat. Besides these the major recipients of the remaining fertilizer use are sugarcane, cotton,\\npotato, plantation and horticulture crops. The lowest fe rtilizer use is in rainfed farming, which covers\\nnearly 66 per cent of the total cropped area in the country. It hardly needs to be stressed that in these\\nrainfed areas more from deficiency than moisture inadequacy. But the later is more appreciated than the\\nformer. There are also wide differences in the consumption ratio of three major nutrients N:P 2O5:K2O\\nin different regions, crops and cropping systems. These differences also got magnified and showed\\naberrations due to adhoc changes in pricing policy of fertilizers during the recent years. This and the\\nNPK ratio for India changed from 5.9:2.4:1.0 in 1991-92 to 9.7:2.9:1.0 in 1993-94. There is also\\ndivergence in ratios in different regions. While the ratio in 1995-96 was 41.4:8.5: 1.0 in northern states\\nand 3.8:1.4:1.0 in southern states. Such divergence in  new ratio is also due to the differences in the\\nquality of land, inherent soil fertility, cropping systems and degree of exploitive agriculture.\\nSoil test summarizes indicate that 98 per cent Indian soils have low to medium available P and\\n60 per cent medium K status whereas, N continues to be universally deficient. 47 per cent soils are\\ndeficient in Zn, 12 per cent Cu and 4 per cent in Mn. In some states and crops, the deficiency of B and\\nMo are also becoming limiting factors for crop production. In recent years, a phenomenal increase in\\nS deficiency has been witnessed specially under intensive cropping system where high analysis fertilizers\\ndevoid of S are used. The S deficiency is more pronounced in crops like oil seeds, legumes and\\nintensively fertilized rice and wheat. In fact, the spectrum of S deficiency is increasing so rapidly that\\nin future, it will become one of the major yield limiting factors. It is said that the planners are more\\nconcerned with the yield barriers of some high yielding varieties but do not seem to be concerned with'),\n",

Thus in a situation where besides NPK, the nutrients such as Zn, Fe, Mn, Cu, B and S are also\\nbecoming limiting factors. It is unthinkable to have a sustained food security without balanced and\\nintegrated use of nutrients from external sources. The spectrum of nutrient deficiency is becoming more\\napparent under areas of intensive cr opping systems which are the main contributors of National food\\nstock of Food Corporation of India. There are signs of yield stagnation and low responses to fertilizers\\nand other inputs because of imbalanced fertilizer use.\\nNitrogen no doubt is the most limiting factor for Indian agriculture, but nitrogen alone is not\\nenough and fertilizer does not mean nitr ogen fertilizers only. Lack of this appreciation has led to poor\\nresults in most cases. Improving N use efficiency is the major problem for improving economy of its\\nuse especially in rice growing areas. Green manuring with legumes and other means of biological\\nnitrogen fixations such as through BGA, Azolla, etc., can contribute to some of the N needs of rice crop\\nbut there are numerous technological, economic and operational problems to their use. At best, they can\\nbe relied upon for 30-60 kg supply under good management. The efficiency of use of biofertilizers is\\nmore crop specific, location specific and management specific and unless, there is a reliable system of\\nquality control and a good system of storage, transportation and management in the field, the expected\\ncontribution will not be realized. No doubt the aw areness of balanced use of fertilizers is growing, but\\nenormously wide N:P:K ratio are a matter of great concern. It is amazing that NPK ratios in Haryana\\nduring 1995-96 was 186:42:1 as against 64:14:1 in Punjab and 1.9:0.6: 1 in Tamil Nadu as against\\n8.9:2.8:1 in whole of India. Bringing this ratio closer to the desirable ratio of 4:2:1 for cereals is\\nessential for maximizing the efficiency of fertilizers. The situation of P and K is more worrisome in\\nIndia. The declining use efficiency of fertilizer s and of soil productivity is other matters of concern.\\nThis fatiguing effect is more prominent in frontier sta tes of green revolution such as Punjab, Haryana,\\nUttar Pradesh and other intensively cropped areas of the country. It has been estimated that annually we\\nare robbing the soil of more nutrients in the form of biomass than returning to it in the form of fertilizer\\nand manures. The annual negative balance seems to be of the order of about 10 m.t. of NPK. It will\\nbecome manifold when we attempt doubling the producti vity and production. If this nutrient drain\\ncontinues, the sustained high productivity and sustainabil ity of agriculture will be an impossible task.\\nIndia is adding every year population to one Australia and New Zealand and it is estimated that by\\n2025, the population of the country will touch 1.4 billion mark. For feeding such a large population,\\nIndia may need about 300 million tones of food grains annually. It may require 35-45 m.t. of nutrients\\nfrom both organic and inorganic sources of fe rtilizers. Besides these, it will also need thousand tones\\nof Zn, Fe, Mn, Cu and B. It is not only the huge amount s of fertilizer nutrients which matters but also\\nthe use efficiency and management system which will determine their economics or benefit/cost ratio\\nis equally important. Thus the key to future national food security and national security lies in balanced\\nand integrated supply and management system, and there is no alternative to it. Balanced fertilizer use\\nis also necessary to improve the economics or profitability of fertilizer use which provides incentive to\\nfarmer for its efficient use. It also improves the quality of the produce which is very much in demand\\nfor the export market as well as for home market. It hardly needs to be stressed that many wrong notions\\nabout fertilizer use spoiling the soil quality are related to imbalanced and imprudent use of nitrogenous\\nfertilizers only.\\nNo single source of plant nutrient, whether it is chemi cal fertilizer or organic manure or green\\nmanure or biofertilizer or crop residue is in a position to meet the growing crop nutrient need. Moreo-\\nver, the right kind of nutrients required by the crop crops may not be achieved from a single source. For\\nexample, different chemical fertilizers can supply the nutrients like N, P, K, Zn and S; Green manuring\\nuse can meet a part of N requirement, one t organic manure can add about 12 kg NPK and also some'),\n",

The distinguishing features of these two types of farming are given in\\nTable 13.1.\\nThe words “Arid” and “Semiarid” must be understood differentially from dry farming. All the dry\\nfarming areas are located in arid and semi arid regions only. But not all the arid and semiarid regions\\ncome under dry farming areas. When irrigation facilities are available, irriga ted farming is practiced\\nextensively in arid and semiarid regions also. Similarly the two words arid/semiarid and tropical/\\ntemperate must be understood correctly. Arid or semiarid refers to moisture re gimes where as tropical\\nor temperate refers to thermal (temperature) regimes of an area.\\nA.  Arid Regions of the World\\nThe climate of arid region is characterized by very low rainfall, usually less than 200 mm per year,\\noccurring in a very short period, rainless dry spells, may at times, stretch for more than a year. Depend-\\ning on temperature regimes and location from the equator, the arid reg ions are classified into Arid\\nTropics with mean annual temperature exceeding 18ºC and Arid Temperate regions with mean annual\\ntemperature less than 18ºC. The following are the five arid zones in the world:\\n1. North African Eurasian–Sahara and Tar desert\\n2. North American desert–Arizona in USA\\n3. South Amer ican desert–Peru\\n4. South African desert–Namibia\\n5. Australian desert–Central Australia\\nB.  Semi Arid Regions of the World\\nDepending on distance from the equator and temperature regimes, semi arid regions are divided into\\nSemi Arid Tropics, usually termed as SAT re gions and semi arid temperate regions.\\n(a) Semi arid tropics (SAT): This region lies between 10º and 30º N and S latitudes. It is spread\\nover 48 countries in four continents of Asia, Australia , America and Africa. It covers many parts in\\nAfrica, India, Pakistan and North Eastern Burma in Asia, Northern Australia and Mexico, Paraguay,\\nBolivia and V enezuela in South America. The total area of SAT is estimated to be 18.9 million square\\nkilometers. West Africa accounts for 24% of semi arid tropics, East Africa 18%, South Africa 20%,\\nLatin America 17%, A ustralia 10% and South Asia 11%. A semi arid climate is essentially a mixed\\nclimate in which a fair ly moist or rainy season alternates with a completely dry season. Hence, the\\nclimate is described as alternating wet and dry climate. Rainfall occurs during 2-7 months of the year.\\nWhen number of wet months is 2.0-4.5, it is described as dry SA T and when rainy month ranges from\\n4.5 to 7.0, it is called as wet SAT. Rainfall quantity ranges from 400-750 mm per year, with a variability\\nof 20-30%. But, the onset, closure and duration of rainy season exhibits wide variability between years.\\nDistribution of rainfall within the season also exhibits wide fluctuations between years. A greater\\nportion of rainfall is received in high intensity over a short duration, leading to run off. Mean annual\\ntemperature is more than 18ºC and during most months, PET is higher than precipitation. Soil moisture\\ninadequacy is the major constraint for cropping.\\n(b) Semi arid temperate region:  It covers in Russia, North Western China, USA and Canada.\\nThough annual rainfall is low, PET also is low during many months.

Temperature\\nThe tropic of cancer, which passes through the middle of the country, divides it into two distinct\\nclimates. The tropical c limate in the South where all the 12 months of the year have mean daily\\ntemperature exceeding 20°C; and in the North where a sub-tropical climate prevails. In sub-tropics\\nduring the winter months, it is cool to cold. Frosts occur sometime during the months of December and\\nJanuary. Some areas in the Northern India have a temperate climate. Here, it snows during the winter\\nmonths and freezing temperatures ma y extend to two months or more during the year.\\nC. Rainfall\\nRainfall in India varies considerably. In some parts of the Thar desert, located in Western Rajasthan, the\\nannual rainfall is as low as 100 mm; while in the East, the annual rainfall may be as high as 10,000 mm\\nor more. In some areas, it may rain for a month or two during the year, in others as many as 11 months\\nmay be rainy.\\nRainfall aberrations - Deficit in the quantity of rainfall adversely affects crops growth through\\ninadequate supply of moisture. It leads to lower yield and even complete crop failure. High intensity\\nrainfall causes runoff and soil erosion. It reduces the storage of rainfall in the soil. Erratic distribution\\nleads to long dry spells during crop growth a nd cause moisture stress. High variability in the onset of\\nrainy season affects time of so wing. Delayed onset also affects crop choice. Early withdrawal or ces-\\nsation of rainfall before the normal time of closur e will lead to moisture stress at maturity and reduce\\ncrop yield. Dry spells during rainy season affect crop growth depending on length of dry spell, sage of\\noccurrence and soil type.

There are two types of monsoons received in\\nIndia. During the main rainy season extending fr om June/July to September/October, the rains we\\nreceive are called as Southwest monsoons. They ar e called thus, because the rainy season sets in first\\nin the South of India and rains progress gradually towards the West of the country.\\n(i) Onset of monsoon: At Trivandrum in Kerala State, the south-west monsoon breaks around June\\n1; at Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh around June 5; at Mumbai around June 10; and at Jaipur or\\nJodhpur towards end of June or early July. The normal dates of onset are just averages, in actual\\nterms there may be a week or 10 days delay or earliness. These are just guide dates for agricul-\\ntural operations or crop calendars. The actual dates vary from year to year. North-east monsoons\\noccur due to cyclonic disturbances in the Bay of Beng al. Their normal date of onset is between\\nNovember 1 and November 15. These rains withdraw by about end of January and occur in areas\\nlocated below 10°N latitude in India.\\n(ii) Rainfall distribution: The rainy season extends to about 2-4 months across most of agricultural\\nregions in Northern and North-west India; it extends to 5 months in Peninsular India ( e.g.,\\nHyderabad), and is of a much long er duration in some Southern areas ( e.g., Bangalore or\\nTrivandrum).\\n(iii) Rainfall climatology: Study of rainfall over a long period is called rainfall climatology. It\\nreveals general pattern of rainfa ll of a particular place. It helps in understanding the amount,\\nintensity, distribution and other rainfall characteristics. Rainfall analysis also helps in classifica-\\ntion of climate. Suitable and efficient cr opping systems can be developed by understanding the\\nrainfall pattern. Rainfall analysis helps in taking decisions on time of sowing, scheduling irriga-\\ntion, time of harvesting etc. It is necessary for designing farm ponds, tanks or irrigation projects.\\nAmount, distribution and intensity of rainfall ar e the important aspects of rainfall that have\\nconsiderable influence on crop production.\\n     Precipitation is water in liquid or solid forms, falling to the earth. It always precedes conden-\\nsation or sublimation or a combination of the two and is primarily associated with raising air. In\\nthe same way, isotherms and isobars are used to show temperature and pressure distribution\\nrespectively, isohyets for rainfall distribution. An isohyet is a line connecting points with equal\\nvalues of rainfall. Change of state from water vapour to liquid water is condensation. When\\nmoist air comes in contact with cool surfaces, it may be cooled to the point where its capacity\\nto hold water vapour is exceeded by the actual amount in the air. Part of the water vapour then\\ncondenses into liquid form on the cool surface, produce dew. When this happens, the latent heat\\nof vaporization, in this process, called the latent heat of condensation is released. At temperature\\nbelow freezing, water may bypass the liquid form in its change of state. When dry air with a\\ntemperature well below freezing comes in contact with ice, molecules of ice (H2O) pass directly\\ninto the vapour state by the processes of sublimation.\\n(iv) Forms of precipitation:  Condensation forms of fog, dew and frost are not considered to be\\nprecipitation. The common precipitation forms are r ain, drizzle, snow, sleet and hail. Of these,\\ndrizzle and light snow are the only forms likely to fall from clouds having little or no vertical\\ndevelopment. Fog results when atmospheric water vapour condenses to water droplets or ice\\ncrystals, become visible and will have their base in contact with ground.\\n(v) Types of rainfall based on distribution: In India, all areas located between 20°N of equator to\\n40°N, the rainfall is unimodal and almost all of the annual rainfall is received due to South-west\\nmonsoons. In South India, the areas located below 10°N, the rainfall is bimodal or it has two\\npeaks–one peak during the South-west rainy season and the second peak in North-east monsoon.'),\n",

Though rainfall has major\\ninfluence on crops yield, yields are not always directly proportional to the amount of precipita-\\ntion. Rainfall may also be in excess of the optimum and thereby cause reduced yields, which\\nmay appear paradoxical to semi-arid climates. When the rainfall is concentrated in 4-5 months\\nof the year, there may be periods when the rate of precipitation exceeds the intake rate of soil.\\nAs a result, considerable runoff occurs, plant nutrients are leached out of the root zone and crops\\nare adversely affected by anaerobic conditions (g ermination, establishment etc.), especially if\\nthe excess precipitation occurs during the cool season.

Intensity of rainfall: Intensity of rainfall mainly influences soil erosion. Study of rainfall inten-\\nsity helps in probable period of floods,  filling of irrigation tanks etc. If the intensity of rainfall\\nexceeds the rate of soil infiltration, runoff starts. High intensity rainfall causes soil erosion. The\\nrunoff from hills and mountain slopes is collected in tanks. The relationship between intensity\\nof rainfall and runoff is given below:\\nLess than 12.5 mm - Runoff is rare\\n12.5–25.0 mm - Runoff in 35% occasions\\n25.0–50.0 mm - Runoff in 80% occasions\\nAbove 50.0 mm - Runoff in 100% occasions\\n2. Distribution of rainfall: The amount of rainfall received at periodic intervals like weeks, months,\\nseasons etc. indicates distribution. In addition, distribution of rainfall can be known by the\\nlength of dry spells, wet spells and rainy days. Distribution of rainfall is more important than\\ntotal rainfall. It can be illustrated with following example taking rainfall related indices of\\nHyderabad and Sholapur.\\nIndex Hyderabad Sholapur\\nAnnual rainfall (mm) 764 742\\nSeasonal rainfall (mm) 580 556\\nCoefficient of variation (%) 26 28\\nPotential evapotranspiration (mm) 1757 1802\\nGrowing season (days) 130 148\\nSoil V ertisol V ertisol\\nIt is apparent from the data that annual rainfall is fairly similar at both locations as seasonal\\nrainfall.

The growing season is slightly less at Hyderabad compared to Sholapur. From\\nthe above, one could probably anticipate that the production potentials are quite similar. How-\\never, rainy season crops are successful at Hyderabad and the annual yields range from 5,000 to\\n7,000 kg/ha while at Sholapur rainy season crops are risky and annual yields range from 1,000\\nto 2,000 kg/ha. Low grain yields at Sholapur are mainly due to discontinuous rainfall or long\\nbreaks in rainfall during the crop period.\\n3. Dependability/reliability of rainfall: Rainfall in dry farming regions is characterized by high\\nvariability and less reliability. The variability occurs in quantity of rainfall, onset and closure of\\nrainy seasons, duration of rainfall and distr ibution within rainy season. T he spatial variability\\nrefers to the variability of rainfall between two locations and the temporal variability refers to\\nthe variations over time i.e., between years, between seasons and within season. V ariability of\\nrainfall is the greatest hazard to crop production in the dry farming regions. The dependability\\ncan be estimated by 75 per cent probability rainfall and by coefficient of variation. It indicates\\nthat there is 75 per cent probability of receiving a particular amount of rainfall in three years out\\nof four years. It can be estimated by arranging the amount of rainfall present at the three-fourth’s\\nplace in the descending order line is the 75 per cent probability rainfall.\\nEXAMPLE\\n           Annual rainfall during different years                          Rainfall arranged in descending order\\nYears Amount (mm) Amount (mm) Ascending order\\n1950 850 1020 1\\n1951 950 950 2\\n1952 1020 870 3\\n1953 625 850 4\\n1954 750 750 5\\n1955 550 725 6\\n1956 650 650 7\\n1957 475 631 8\\n1958 631 625 9\\n1959 725 550 10\\n1960 870 525 11\\n1962 525 475 12\\nOut of 12 years, 631 mm and above rainfall was received in eight years and it is the 75 per cent\\nprobability rainfall.\\nCoefficient of V ariation (CV%): By calculating coefficient of variation, the variation in rainfall can\\nbe quantified.

Much of the increase in food production in the recent past is estimated to be mainly\\ndue to irrigated areas. Since 1950, the extent of irrigated land in the world has increased from 94 m.ha\\nto about 220 m.ha. During the 1980s, however, the rate of irrigation development has dropped materially\\nand is presently less than 1 per cent per year, whereas the world population is increasing at 1.7 per cent\\nper annum. Irrigated land accounts for 18 per cent of the cultivated land but produces 33 per cent of the\\nfood. The cost of irrigation and drainage development of new systems averages over $5,000 per ha and\\ncan be as high as $10,000. Therefore, it is inevitab le that in future, the additional food has to come\\nmainly from the dry lands. With the current pace of irrigation development, it is assumed that the gross\\nirrigated area is likely to increase to 75 × 10 6 ha and more than 55 per cent of the gross cropped area\\nwill continue to be farmed under rainfed conditions. In India, nearly 43 m.ha out of 143 m.ha of the\\ncultivated area was irrigated, leaving the remaining 100 m.ha as rainfed. According to experts, even\\nwhen the ultimate irrigation potential is reached, 55 per cent of the net sown area will be still, rainfed.\\nThe contribution (production) of rainfed agriculture in India is about 45 per cent of the total food grain,\\n75 per cent of oilseeds, 90 per cent of pulses and about 70 per cent of cotton. In the 21st century, the\\ncontribution of dry lands will have to be 60 per cent if India is to provide adequate food to 1090 m\\npeople. Hence, tremendous efforts both in the development and research fronts are essential to achieve\\nthis target. More than 90 per cent of the area under sorghum, groundnut, and pulses is rainfed. In case\\nof maize and chickpea, 82-85 per cent area is rainfed. Even 78 per cent of cotton area is rainfed. In case\\nof rapeseed/mustard, about 66 per cent of the area is rainfed. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, 62, 44,\\nand 35 per cent area under rice, barley and wheat, respectively, is rainfed.\\nAlthough, India is blessed with average annual rainfall of about 1200 mm, slightly above the global\\nmean of 990 mm, the fate of dry land crops oscillates with the quantity, onset, and progress, spatial and\\ntemporal distribution of monsoon rains. Of the mean annual rainfall, 30 per cent of the country gets less\\nthan 750 mm and 40 per cent between 750 and 1250 mm. Only 20 per cent area is blessed with rainfall\\nbetween 1250 and 2000 mm, leaving about 10 per cent area with annual rainfall over 2000 mm. A\\ncritical appraisal of the existing rainwater availability shows that:\\n\\x7f India receives 400 M ha m of rain water annually,\\n\\x7f About 160 M ha m falls on agricultural land,\\n\\x7f Nearly 24 M ha m is available for harvesting in small scale water harvesting structures,'),\n",

The low productivity of agriculture\\nin dry farming regions is due to the cumulative ef fect of many constraints for crop production. The\\nconstraints can be broadly grouped into:\\n\\x7f Climatic constraints,\\n\\x7f Soil related constraints,\\n\\x7f Cultivation practices, and\\n\\x7f Socio economic and political constraints.\\nI. Climatic constraints\\n\\x7f High atmospheric temperature\\n\\x7f Low relative humidity\\n\\x7f Hot dry winds\\n\\x7f High atmospheric water demand (potential evapotr anspiration) exceeding precipitation during\\nmost part of the year\\n\\x7f V agaries of monsoon.\\n(i) Variable rainfall - Annual rainfall varies greatly from year to year and na turally its coefficient\\nof variation. Generally, higher the rainfall less is the coefficient of variation. In other words, crop\\nfailures due to uncertain rains are more frequent in regions with lesser rainfall.\\n(ii) Intensity and distribution - In general, more than 50 per cent of total rainfall is usually received\\nin 3–5 rainy days. Such intensive rain fall results in substantial loss of water due to surface\\nrunoff. This process also accelerates soil erosion. Distribution of rainfall during the crop-growing\\nseason is more important than total rainfall in dry land agriculture.\\n(iii) Late onset of monsoon - If the onset of monsoon is delayed, crops/varieties recommended to\\nthe region cannot be sown in time. Delayed sowing lead to uneconomical crop yields.\\n(iv) Early withdrawal of monsoon - This situation is equally or more dangerous than late onset of\\nmonsoon. Rainy season crops will be subjected to terminal stress leading to poor yields. Similarly,\\npost-rainy season crops fail due to inadequate available soil moisture, especially during\\nreproductive and maturity phases.\\n(v) Prolonged dry spells - Breaks of monsoon for 7–10 days may not be a serious concern. Breaks\\nof more than 15 days duration especially at critical stages for soil moisture stress leads to\\nreduction in yield. Drought due to break in monsoon may adversely affect the crops in shallow\\nsoils than in deep soils.\\nII. Soil constraints\\nThe soil constraints are: 1. Inadequate soil moisture availability, 2. Poor organic matter content, 3. Poor\\nsoil fertility, and 4. Soil deterior ation due to erosion (wind, water).\\nIII. Cultivation practices\\nThe existing management practices adopted by the farmers are evolved based on long-term experience\\nby the farmers. The analysis of traditional system revealed that on one hand, the traditional system\\nsuffers due to the fact that yield levels are low and unstable, while on the other hand, it has strong points\\ndue to which it has stood the test of time.

Ground-\\nnut and red gram are sown in 6:1 ratio. Sorghum black gram, green gram and Lab-Lab (mochai)\\ncrops are broadcasted. Cotton + black gram is sown in 6:1 ratio or black gram is sown in border.\\nEven though the yield is less, there is some stability in yield due to mixed cropping and it is an\\ninsurance against risk of complete failure.\\n\\x7f Traditional system of harvesting processing consumes more labourers, but it can be followed\\nbecause of no loss in grain during the process of harvest.\\n\\x7f Traditional storage is based on sound practical knowledge as well as it involves low cost technology\\n\\x7f In certain pockets, pre monsoon sowing or early so wing of crops are taken.\\n\\x7f Inter cultivation with plough in between crop rows is one of the best insitu soil moisture\\nconservation techniques.\\nWeakness in traditional system - Most management practices are not aimed at soil moisture conservation.\\nTraditional system does not build up nutrient status in the so il; on the contrary it depletes the fertility\\nstatus.

This has been responsible for\\ndroughts and famines. The word drought generally denotes scarcity of water in a region. Though,\\naridity and drought are due to insufficient water, aridity is a permanent climatic fe ature and is the\\nculmination of a number of long-term processes. However, drought is a temporary condition that occurs\\nfor a short period due to deficient precipitation for ve getation, river flow, water supply and human\\nconsumption. Drought is due to anomaly in atmospheric circulation. The difference between aridity and\\ndrought is given in Table 13.6.\\nTable 13.6.

Aridity\\nAridity refers to a condition of deficiency of water due to either insufficient precipitation or excess\\nwater loss over supply. The term “arid” is derived from a Latin word, “arere” which means ‘dry’.\\nAssessment of the degree of aridity of a place is necessary to serve as a base for the application of\\ntechnology, for the interpretation of resource assessment and for transfer of technology. It is also useful\\nto analyze the climatic res ources and to identify specific climatic constraints for planning agricultural\\ndevelopment. The degree of aridity can be assessed from climatic parameters and plant criteria. Some\\nimportant indices related to aridity are given below.\\nIndices of Aridity:\\n1. Thornthwaite and Mather (1955): The classification of Thornthwaite (1948) was modified for\\nthe Moisture Index (I m) and is given below:\\nIm = 100 [(P-PE)/PE]\\nwhere, P = Precipitation,\\nPE = Potential evapotranspiration\\nIm Quantity Climate classification\\n100 and above Per humid\\n20−100 Humid\\n0–20 Moist sub humid\\n−33.3−0 Dry sub humid\\n−66.7 to −33.3 Semi arid\\n−100 to −66.7 Arid'),\n",

Drought\\nI. Definition\\nThere is no universally accepted definition for drought. Early workers defined drought as prolonged\\nperiod without rainfall. A ccording to Ramdas (1960), drought is a situation when the actual seasonal\\nrainfall is deficient by more than twice the mean deviation. American Meteorological Society defined\\ndrought as a period of abnormally dry weather sufficiently prolonged for lack of water to cause a severe\\nhydrological imbalance in the area affected. Prolonged deficiencies of soil moisture adversely affect\\ncrop growth indicating incidence of ag ricultural drought. It is the result of imbalance between soil\\nmoisture and evapotranspiration needs of an area over a fairly long period as to cause damage to\\nstanding crops and to reduce the yields. The irrigation commission of India defines drought as a\\nsituation occurring in any area where the annual rainfall is less than 75% of normal rainfall.\\nII. Classification\\nDrought can be classified based on duration, nature of users, time of occurrence and using some\\nspecific terms. Demarcation between the classifications is not well defined and many times, overlap-\\nping of the cause and effect of one on the rest is seen.'),\n",

Based on duration\\n(a) Permanent drought - This is characteristic of the desert climate where sparse vegetation grow-\\ning is adapted to drought and agriculture is possible only by irrigation during entire crop season.\\n(b) Seasonal drought - This is found in climates with well-defined rainy and dry seasons. Most of\\nthe arid and semiarid zones fall in this category. Duration of the crop varieties and planting dates\\nshould be such that the growing season should fall within rainy season.\\n(c) Contingent drought - This involves an abnormal failure of rainfall. It may occur almost any-\\nwhere especially in most parts of humid or sub humid clima tes. It is usually brief, irregular and\\ngenerally affects only a small area.\\n(d) Invisible drought - This can occur even when there is frequent rain in an area. When rainfall is\\ninadequate to meet the evapotranspiration losses, the result is borderline water deficiency in soil\\nresulting in less than the optimum yield. This occurs usually in humid regions.\\n2. Based on nature of the users (NCA, 1976)\\n(a) Meteorological drought - It is defined as a condition, where the annual precipitation is less than\\nthe normal over an area for prolonged period (month, season or year).\\n(b) Atmospheric drought - It is due to low air humidity, frequently accompanied by hot dry winds.\\nIt may occur even under conditions of adequate available soil moisture. It refers to a condition\\nwhen plants show wilting symptoms during the hot part of the day, when transpiration exceeds\\nabsorption temporarily for a short period. When decreases,  absorption keeps pace with transpi-\\nration and plants revive (mid day wilt).\\n(c) Hydrological drought - Meteorological drought, when prolonged results in hydrological drought\\nwith depletion of surface water and consequent drying of reservoirs, tanks etc. It results in\\ndeficiency of water for all sectors using water. This is based on water balance and how it affects\\nirrigation as a whole for bringing crops to maturity.\\n(d) Agricultural drought - It is the result of soil moisture stress due to imbalance between available\\nsoil moisture and evapotranspiration of a crop. It is usually gradual and progressive. Plants can\\ntherefore, adjust at least partly, to the increased soil moisture stress. This situation arises as a\\nconsequence of scanty precipitation or its uneven distribution both in space and time. It is also\\nusually referred as soil drought.\\nRelevant definition of agricultural drought appears to be a period of dryness during the crop season,\\nsufficiently prolonged to adversely affect the yield. The extent of yield loss depends on the crop growth\\nstage and the degree of stress. It does not be gin when the rain ceases, but actually commences only\\nwhen the plant roots are not able to obtain the soil moisture rapidly enough to replace evapotranspiration\\nlosses. Important causes for agricultural drought are:\\n\\x7f Inadequate precipitation,\\n\\x7f Erratic distribution,\\n\\x7f Long dry spells in the monsoon,\\n\\x7f Late onset of monsoon,\\n\\x7f Early withdrawal of monsoon, and\\n\\x7f Lack of proper soil and crop management\\n3. Based on time of occurrence\\n(a) Early season drought - It occurs due to delay in onset of monsoon or due to long dry spells after\\nearly sowing.'),\n",

Other terms to describe drought\\n(a) Apparent drought - What is drought for one crop may not be drought for another crop; what is\\ndrought in red soil may not be drought in black soil.\\n(b) Physiological drought - It refers to a condition where crops are unable to absorb water from soil\\neven when water is available, due to the high osmotic pressure of soil solution due to increased\\nsoil concentration, as in saline and alkaline soils. It is not due to deficit of water supply.\\nIII. Periodicity of drought:\\nThe Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) examined the incidence of drought for the period from\\n1871 to 1967, utilizing the monthly rainfall of 306 stations in the country. It was seen that during 1877,\\n1899, 1918 and 1972, more than 40 per cent of the total area experienced drought. General observation\\non the periodicity of drought in respect of different meteorological subdivisions of India is given Table\\n13.7.\\nTable 13.7.

Drought periods:\\n(i) Beginning of drought: Droughts do not occur in Assam, South Kerala and eastern part of West\\nBengal. Severe drought begins on 1st October in the northwest arid zone and even much earlier\\nin the western parts of the country. In the southern arid zone and adjoining interior portion of\\nMaharashtra, the severe drought begins by the end of November. In most of the central portion\\nof the country to the east of the line joining Delhi, Udaipur and Baroda, the commencement is\\nonly in the month of February or later. This is due to high water holding capacity of the black\\nsoil region. In the western coastal region of Maharashtra and Karnataka, the rainfall is very high.\\nIn spite of this, severe drought begins by December-January, probably because of the lower\\nwater holding capacity of the soil. Severe drought commences only after April in Gwalior, Guna,\\nJabalpur, Pendra, and Satna regions of Madhya Pradesh.\\n(ii) Closure of drought: In general, severe drought ends outside the regions of east Bihar, Tamil\\nNadu, Karnataka, and southern Andhra Pradesh only by 1st May. In most of these regions, it\\nends after 15th May. In the arid zone of northw est India, severe drought ends normally during'),\n",

Drought on crop production:\\n• Water relations: Drought alters the water status by its influence on absorption, translocation\\nand transpiration. The lag in absorption behind tr anspiration results in loss of turgor as a result\\nof increase in the atmospheric dryness.\\n\\x7f Photosynthesis:  Photosynthesis is reduced by moisture stress due to reduction in photosynthetic\\nrate, chlorophyll content, leaf area and incr ease in assimilates saturation in leaves (due to lack\\nof translocation).\\n\\x7f Respiration: Respiration increases with mild dr ought but more severe  drought lowers water\\ncontent and respiration.\\n\\x7f Anatomical changes: Decrease in size of the cells and intercellular spaces, thicker cell wall and\\ngreater development of mechanical tissue are the anatomical changes. Stomata per unit leaf tend\\nto increase.\\n\\x7f Metabolic reaction:  Almost, all metabolic reactions are affected by water deficits.\\n\\x7f Hormonal relationships altered: The activity of growth promoting hormones like cytokinin,\\ngibberlic acid and indole acetic acid decreases and growth regulating hormone like abscisic acid,\\nethylene etc. increases.\\n\\x7f Nutrition: The fixation, uptake and assimilation of N is affected. Since dry matter production\\nis considerably reduced, the uptake of NPK is reduced.\\n\\x7f Growth and Development: Drought results in decrease in growth of leaves, stems and fruits.\\nMaturity is delayed if drought occurs before flowering, while it advances if drought occurs after\\nflowering.\\n\\x7f Reproduction and grain growth: Drought at flowering and grain development determines the\\nnumber of fruits and individual grain weight, respectively. Panicle initiation in cereals is critical\\nwhile drought at anthesis may lead to drying of pollen. Drought at grain development reduces\\nyield while vegetative and grain-filling stages are less sensitive to moisture stress.\\n\\x7f Yield: The effect on yield depends on what proportion of the total dry matter is considered as\\nuseful material to be harvested. If it is aerial and underground parts, effect of drought is as\\nsensitive as total growth. When the yield consists of seeds as in cereals, moisture stress at\\nflowering is detrimental. When the yield is fibre or chemicals where economic product is a small\\nfraction of total dry matter, moderate stress on growth does not have adverse effect on yields.\\n13.5 SOIL MOISTURE CONSTRAINTS\\nInadequate soil moisture availability is the major constraint in dry farming. All the above factors\\ndirectly and indirectly affect the soil moisture. Availability of soil moisture to crops is affected by\\nrainfall behavior as well as by various soil properties.\\n\\x7f Shallow soils, degraded soils, eroded soils, grav elly soils and coarse textured soils have poor\\nwater holding capacity and hence can not store much of rainfall.\\n\\x7f Wind and water erosion remove the finer soil particles and expose the hard, impermeable subsoil\\ncausing less infiltration and less water storage.\\n\\x7f Crusting of soil surface after rainfall reduces infiltra tion and storage of rainfall, due to high run\\noff.'),\n",

By increased rainfall use efficiency\\nI. Tillage\\nTillage may be described as the practice of modifying the state of the soil in order to provide conditions\\nfavourable to crop growth. The objectives of tillage in dry lands are to:\\n\\x7f develop desired soil structure for a seedbed , which allows rapid infiltration and good retention\\nof rainfall.\\n\\x7f minimize soil erosion by following practices as contour tillage, tillage across the slope etc.\\n\\x7f control weeds and remove unwanted crop plants.\\n\\x7f manage crop residues, through mixing of trash is desirable for achieving good tilth and decom-\\nposition of residues. However, the retention of trash on top layers is also useful in reducing\\nerosion.

Deep tillage\\nof 25–30 cm is beneficial for deep heavy clay soils to improve permeability and to close cracks\\nformed while drying. In soils with hard pans, deep tillage once in 2–3 years with chisel plough\\nup to 35–45 cm depth at 60–120 cm interval will increase effective depth for rooting and\\nmoisture storage. Deep tillage is preferable for cotton, red gram and other deep-rooted crops. It\\nis not recommended for shallow, gravelly, light textured soils.\\nMedium deep tillage  of 15–20 cm depth is generally sufficient for most soils and crops. It is\\nrecommended for medium deep soils, shallow rooted crops, soils with pan free horizon and for\\nstubble incorporation. Shallow tillage up to 10 cm is followed in light textured soils, and shallow\\nsoils and in soils highly susceptible to erosion. In soils prone for surface crusting, shallow\\nsurface stirring or shallow harrowing is useful.\\n(b) Time of tillage - Early completion of tillage is often helpful to enable sowing immediately after\\nrainfall and before the soil dries up.

It is\\nparticularly useful for pre-monsoon sowing.\\n(c) Direction of tillage - For moisture conservation, ploughing across slope or along contour is very\\neffective. Plough furrows check the velocity of runoff, promote more infiltration when water\\nstagnates in the depressions caused by plough furrows and improves soil moisture storage.\\n(d) Intensity of tillage  - It refers to the number of times tillage is done. Frequent ploughing in\\nshallow light textured soils will pulverize the soils into fine dust and increase the susceptibility\\nto erosion. In heavy soils, leaving the land in a rough and cloddy stage prior to sowing is useful\\nfor more depression storage. The concept of minimal tillage is also practiced in dry lands. Here\\ntillage is confined to seeding zone only and the inter-space is not tilled. It not only saves time,\\nenergy and cost but also helps moisture conservation. The practice of “set line cultivation”\\nadopted in some dry regions is an example of minimum tillage. Here the seed row space is fixed\\nand season after season, tillage is done only in this seeding strip. The intervening strip is not\\ntilled.\\n(e) Modern concept of tillage - In dry lands, rainfall is receiv ed simultaneously over a large area.\\nIn order to ensure timely sowing before soil dries up, the interval between land preparations and\\nsowing must be narrowed down. This calls for completion of tillage over a large area in quick\\ntime. Dependence on bullock power and traditional wooden plough may not help in this regard.\\nUse of more efficient tillage implements and mechanization of tillage operations are warranted.\\nTillage in dry lands also encompasses land shaping for in situ soil moisture conservation. Imple-\\nments that can carryout tillage and land shaping in one single operation will help in saving time\\nand cost. If land preparation, land shaping and sowing can be done in one single operation it can\\nsave considerable time. This is termed as once over tillage, plough planting or conservation\\ntillage.

Both systems usually leave crop residue\\non the surface and each operation is planned to maintain continuous soil coverage by residue or\\ngrowing plants. The conservation tillage practices may advance some of the goals of alternative\\nfarming such as increasing organic matter in soil and reducing soil erosion, but some conservation\\ntillage practices may increase the need for pesticides. Conservation tillage changes soil properties\\nin ways that affect plant growth, and reduce water runoff from fields. The mulched soil is cooler\\nand soil surface under the residue is moist, as a result many conser vation tillage systems have\\nbeen successful.\\n(iii) Zero tillage or no-till system: Here, the crop residue is usually shredded and planting is done\\nwithout pre tillage.

Soil erosion and runoff\\nDetachment and transport of soil and soil material caused by water and wind are widely prevalent in dry\\nfarming regions. Erosion takes place in both red so ils and black soils. Soil and water are the most\\ncritical basic resources, which must be conserved as effectively as possible. No phenomenon is more\\ndestructive than soil erosion through which fertile topsoil and rainwater are lost. Soil and water conser-\\nvation is the only known way to protect the lands from degradation and conserving rainwater for\\nimproving the productivity of dry land crops. Runoff leads to wastage of rainf all. Under unchecked\\nconditions, even up to 40% of rainfall may be lost as runoff. Even when moisture conservation practices\\nare adopted, about 10-20% of rainfall may be lost as runoff because of high intensity rainfall. Erosion\\nremoves topsoil and exposes hard impermeable sub soil, increasing the chances of more run off. Ero-\\nsion adversely affects soil physical pr operties such as loss of structure, reduced infiltration, soil depth\\nand soil moisture storage capacity. Loss of topsoil through erosion leads to loss of plant nutrients and\\npoor soil fertility.\\nA. Soil erosion:\\nSoil erosion is the process of detachment of soil particles from the topsoil and transportation of the\\ndetached soil particles by wind and/or water. The detaching agents are falling raindrop, channel flow\\nand wind. The transporting agents are flowing water, rain splash and wind. Out of 328 m.ha. of India’s\\ngeographical area, 175 m.ha. (53.3%) subject to soil erosion and all kind of land degradation. Out of\\nwhich 104.6 m.ha. are cultivable. Recent estimates indica te that about 5,333 mt. (16.35 t/ha) of soil is\\ndetached annually (29% carried away by rivers to the sea, 10% deposited in reservoirs resulting 1–2%\\nloss of storage capacity).\\nTypes of erosion\\n(a) Geological erosion: It is said to be in equilibrium with the soil forming process. It takes place\\nunder natural vegetative cover completely undisturbed by biotic factors. This long time slow\\nprocess has developed the present topographic features like stream channels, valleys, etc., through\\nweather abnormalities such as intensive rainfall and biotic interference.\\n(b) Accelerated erosion: It is due to disturbance in natural equilibrium by the activities of man and\\nanimals through land mismanagement, destruction of forests, overgrazing, etc. Soil loss through\\nerosion is more than the soil formed due to soil forming process.\\n(c) Water erosion: Water and wind are the main agencies responsible for soil erosion. Loss of soil\\nfrom land surface by water, including runoff from melted snow and ice is usually referred to as\\nwater erosion. The major erosive agents in water erosion are impacting raindrops and runoff\\nwater flowing over the soil surface. Erosion and sedimentation embody the processes of detach-\\nment, transportation and deposition of soil particles. Detachment is dislodging of soil particles\\nfrom soil mass by the erosive agents. Transportation is movement of detached soil particles\\n(sediment) from their original location. The sediment moves along the stream and part of it may\\neventually reach the ocean. Some sediment is usually deposited at the base of the slopes, reser-\\nvoirs and flood plains along the way.\\n(i) Forms of water erosion: Sheet, Rill, gully, ravine, landslide and stream bank erosion.\\n(ii) Factors affecting water erosion:\\n\\x7f Rainfall – amount, intens ity, duration and distribution'),\n",

Pr inciples of water erosion control are:\\n\\x7f Maintenance of soil infiltration capacity\\n\\x7f Soil protection from rainfall\\n\\x7f Control of surface runoff\\n\\x7f Safe disposal of surface runoff\\nControl measures are grouped in to agronomic, mechanical and forestry measures\\nAgronomic: Choice of crops, land preparation, contour cultivation, strip cropping, mulching, ap-\\nplication of manures and fertilizers and appropriate cropping systems.\\nMechanical: Contour bunding, graded bunding, bench terracing, contour trenching, gully control\\nand vegetative barriers.\\nForestry: Perennial trees and grasses.\\n(d) Wind erosion - Erosion of soil by the action of wind is known as wind erosion. It is a serious\\nproblem on lands devoid of vegetation. It is more common in arid and semiarid region. It is\\nessentially a dry weather phenomenon stimulated by soil moisture deficiency. The process of\\nwind erosion consists of three phases: initiation of movement, transportation and deposition.\\nAbout 33 m.ha in India is affected by wind erosion. It includes 23.9 m.ha of desert and about\\n6.5 m.ha of coastal sands.\\n(i) Forms of wind erosion:  Transportation of soil particles by wind tak es place in three ways.\\nSaltation: Movement of soil particles by a short series of bounces along the ground surface.\\nSuspension: Movement of fine dust particles,  smaller than 0.1mm dia floating in the air.\\nSurface creep: Rolling and sliding of soil particles along the ground surface due to impact of\\nparticles descending and hitting during saltation is called surface creep.\\n(ii) Factors affecting wind erosion: The factors are soil clodiness, surface roughness, water stable\\naggregates and surface crust (Mechanical stability), wind and soil moisture (surface is dry or\\nslightly moist), field length, vegetative cover, organic matter (cementing), topography and soil\\ntype (sand erodes easily).\\n(iii) Losses due to wind erosion: Fertile topsoil is lost. Fertile soils are converted into unproductive\\nsandy soils drifting sand. Yield losses due to abrasive action of wind driven soil particles,\\nespecially on broad leaved crops.\\n(iv) Wind erosion control: Greatest damage by wind er osion occurs during summer months in dry\\nregions, where soil surface is bare and wind velocity is at its peak. Basic principles of wind\\nerosion control are:\\n\\x7f Reducing wind velocity at ground surface, sufficient to prevent it being able to pickup soil\\nparticles.'),\n",

Summer tillage is a traditional practice helps\\nin the storage of pre-sowing rainfall.

Erosion resistant\\ncrops include grasses and legumes with rapid canopy development. For example, Cenchrus\\nglaucus + Stylosanthes hamata.\\n2. Mechanical methods\\nThe basic principle are: ( i) shaping the land surface manually or with implements in such a way as to\\nreduce the velocity of runoff, ( ii) to allow more time for rainfall to stand on soil surface, and ( iii) to\\nfacilitate more infiltration of rainfall into soil layers.\\nChoice of any particular method under a given situation is influenced by rainfall characters, soil\\ntype, crops, sowing methods and slope of land.\\n(i) Basin listing: Formation of small depressions (basins) of 10–15 cm depth and 10–15 cm width\\nat regular intervals using an implement called basin lister. The small basins collect rainfall and\\nimprove its storage. It is usually done before sowing. It is suitable for all soil types and crops.\\n(ii) Bunding: Formation of narrow based or broad based bunds across slope at  suitable intervals\\ndepending on slope of field. The bunds check the free flow of runoff water, impound the rain-\\nwater in the inter-bund space, increase its infiltration and improve soil moisture storage. Leveling\\nof inter-bund space is essential to ensure uniform spread of water and avoid water stagnation in\\npatches. It can be classified into three types:\\n(a) Contour bunding: Bunds of 1 m basal width, 0.5 m top width and 0.5 m height are formed\\nalong the contour. The distance between two contour bunds depends on slope. The inter-\\nbund surface is leveled and used for cropping. It is suitable for deep red soils with slope less\\nthan 1%. It is not suitable for heavy black soils with low infiltration where bunds tend to\\ndevelop cracks on drying. Contour bunds are permanent structures and require technical\\nassistance and heavy investment.\\n(b) Graded/field bunding: Bunds of 30-45 cm basal width, and 15-20 cm height are formed\\nacross slope at suitable intervals of 20-30 m depending on slope. The inter-bund area is\\nleveled and cropped. It is suitable for medium deep-to-deep red soils with slopes up to 1%.\\nIt is not suitable for black soils due to susceptibility to cracking and breaching. Bunds can\\nbe maintained for 2-3 seasons with reshaping as and when required.\\n(c) Compartmental bunding: Small bunds of 15 cm width and 15 cm height are formed in both\\ndirections (along and across slope) to divide the field into small basins or compartments of\\n40 sq. m. size (8 × 5 m). It is suitable for red soils and black soils with a slope of 0.5-1%.\\nThe bunds can be formed before sowing or immediately after sowing with local wooden\\nplough. It is highly suitable for broadcast sown crops. CRIDA has recommended this method\\nas the best in situ soil moisture conservation measure f or Kovilpatti region of Tamil Nadu.\\nMaize, sunflower, sorghum performs well in this type of bunding.\\n(iii) Ridges and furrows: Furrows of 30-45 cm width and 15-20 cm height are formed across slope.\\nThe furrows guide runoff water safely when rainfall intensity is high and avoid water stagnation.\\nThey collect and store water when rainfall intensity is less. It is suitable for medium deep-to-\\ndeep black soils and deep red soils. It can be practiced in wide row spaced crops like cotton,\\nmaize, chillies, tomato etc. It is not suitable for shallow red soils, shallow black soils and sandy/\\ngravelly soils.

Tie ridging is a modification of the above system of ridges and\\nfurrows where in the ridges are connected or tied by  a small bund at 2–3 m interval along the\\nfurrows. Random tie ridging is another modification where discontinuous furrows of 20–25 cm\\nwidth, 45–60 cm length and 15 cm depth are formed between clumps or hills of crops at the time\\nof weeding. Y et another modification of ridges and furrows method is the practice of sowing in\\nlines on flat beds and formation of furrows between crop rows at 25–30 DAS. This enables\\nsowing behind plough or through seed drill.\\n(iv) Broad Bed Furrow (BBF): Here beds of 1.5 m width, 15 cm height and convenient length are\\nformed, separated by furrows of 30 cm width and 15 cm depth.

Bed former cum seed drill\\nenables BBF formation and sowing simultaneously, thus reducing the delay between rainfall\\nreceipts and sowing.\\n(v) Dead furrow- At the time of sowing or immediately after sowing, deep furrows of 20 cm depth\\nare formed at intervals of 6–8 rows of crops. No crop is raised in the furrow. Sowing and\\nfurrowing are done across slope. It can be done with wooden plough in both black and red soils.\\n3.  Agrostological methods\\nThe use of grasses to control soil erosion, reduce run off and improve soil moisture storage constitutes\\nthe agrostological method. Grasses with their close canopy cover ov er soil surface and profuse root\\nsystem, which binds soil particles, provide excellent protection against runoff and erosion. The follow-\\ning are the various agrostological methods of in situ moisture conservation.\\n(i) Pastures/grass lands: Raising perennial grasses to establish pastures or grass lands is recom-\\nmended for shallow gravelly, eroded, degraded soils. Grass canopy intercepts rainfall, reduces\\nsplash erosion, checks runoff and improves soil moisture storage from rainfall.\\n(ii) Strip cropping with grasses: Alternate strips of grasses and annual field crops arranged across\\nslope check runoff and erosion and help in increasing moisture storage in soil.\\n(iii) Ley farming: It is the practice of growing fod der grasses and legumes and annual crops in\\nrotation. Grasses and legumes like Cenchrus, stylo are grown for 3–5 years and followed by\\nannual crops like sorghum for 2 year. When the field is under grasses or legumes, soil moisture\\nconservation is improved.\\n(iv) Vegetative barriers: Vegetative barrier consists of one or two rows of perennial grasses estab-\\nlished at suitable interval across the slope and along the contour. It serves as a block to free\\nrunoff and soil transport. Vetiver, Cenchrus etc., are suitable grasses. V etiver can be planted in\\nrows at intervals of 40 m in 0.5% slope. Plough furrows are opened with disc plough first before\\ncommencement of monsoon. 5–8 cm deep holes are formed at 20 cm interval and two slips per\\nhole are planted in the beginning of rainy season. The soil around the roots is compacted. V etiver\\nbarriers check runoff and prevent soil erosion. While they retain the soil, they allow excess'),\n",

It is adapted to drought and requires less\\ncare for maintenance. It does not exhibit any bor der effect on crops in adjacent rows. It allows\\nuniform spread of water to lower area in the field resulting in uniform plant stand thus increasing\\nyield of a crop by 10–15%. It facilitates better storage of soil moisture. If fodder grasses like\\nCenchrus glaucus  or marvel grass are used, fodder can also be harvested and given to the\\nanimal. V egetative barriers are best suited for black soil. Unlike contour bunding, which gives\\nway due to development of crack in summer in black soils, vegetative barriers do not allow such\\nphenomenon in black soil. Hence, the vegetative barriers can be effectively maintained in black\\nsoil for 4–5 years. After 4–5 years, replanting material can also be had from the old barrier by\\n‘quartering’\\nIV. Recycling of rainwater\\nRunoff is that portion of precipitation, which makes its ways towards stream, channel, lake or ocean as\\nsurface flow. Mostly runoff refers to surface flow only. Runoff from rainfall is inevitable and cannot be\\ncompletely arrested. In dry far ming areas, rainfall often occurs at high intensity , which exceeds the\\ninfiltration rate and causes runoff. Also, w hen quantity of rainfall exceeds the water holding capacity\\nof soils, runoff has to take place. In certain instances , surface characteristics of soils also cause runoff.\\nUsually, under unchecked conditions, about 40% of rainfall may be lost as runoff. Even if moisture\\nconservation practices are adopted, about 10–15% of rainfall in blac k soils and about 20% of rainfall\\nin red soils is lost as runoff.\\nThe amount of such runoff varies with rainfall intensity, soil physical properties, soil surface\\ncharacters, slope, vegetation cover and cultural pr actices. Runoff water, if not checked, flows out and\\nis wasted, causing soil erosion. It can be guided, collected and recycled to augment water availability\\nto rainfed crops. The collection, storage and recycling of runoff water constitute the process of water\\nharvesting. Water harvesting can be viewed from two situations. First is a case of normal rainfall with\\nhigh intensity on a few rainy days causing runoff. This runoff can be guided and collected in storage\\nstructures called farm ponds and reused for supplemental irrigation to cr ops suffering from moisture\\nstress. This is termed as macro watershed approach or macro catchment water harvesting. In the second\\ninstance, total rainfall is less and soil storage is inadequate for supporting crop growth. Here part of the\\nland is left barren and uncultivated. This is known as donor area and is treated in such a way as to\\nincrease runoff from rainfall. The runoff from the donor strip is directed towards the lower adjacent\\nstrip to increase soil moisture storage there. This strip is used for raising crops. This is called as micro\\nwatershed approach or micr o catchment water harvesting.\\n(i) Water harvesting through farm ponds: The collection of rainwater and storing in big farm\\nponds is not a new concept in India. It is in vogue since early days in the form of tanks. Farm ponds\\nare small storage structures constructed at the lowest point of a farm to collect and store runoff water.\\nRunoff from various parts of the catchment area is properly guided through grassed waterways into the\\nfarm pond. The following points need to be considered while constructing farm ponds.\\n\\x7f Deep heavy soils with low permeability are better suited for farm pond technology than shallow\\nlight soils with high permeability. But, ironically, the usefulness of farm pond is more felt in\\nlight soils with low water storage capacity.\\n\\x7f Farm pond has to be constructed at the lowest point of the farm to collect runoff water from the\\nentire farm area.\\n\\x7f Size of farm pond depends on rainfall quantity, soil type, area of catchment (farm size) and\\nestimated runoff.'),\n",

A chain of farm ponds can recharge ground water in the region.\\n(ii) Water harvesting under deficit rainfall: The situation here is that the seasonal rainfall quan-\\ntity by itself is not sufficient to support a crop till maturity. Therefore, runoff of rainfall from a part of\\nthe land left uncultivated is directed to an adjacent strip, which alone is used for cropping. In this strip\\n(run-on strip/recipient area), the rainfall falling on its surface is supplemented by runoff directed from\\nthe other strip of land (donor area/runoff strip) and total water supply available is increased to facilitate\\ncropping. This can be accomplished by the following practices. A portion of the field in the upper reach\\nis left uncultivated. It is shaped or treated to increase runoff. This can be accomplished by covering the\\nsurface with polythene films or by water proofing it by spraying sodium carbonate or water repellant\\nmaterials like silicone/asphalt or by shaping the land into a sloping, clear, smooth, compact surface to\\nincrease runoff. Runoff from this donor strip is guided to a smaller, strip on the lower reach to increase\\nsoil storage and to raise crops. The proportion of ‘donor area’ to cropped area depends on rainfall\\nquantity, duration of rainfall, soil properties and crop characters. In the cropped area, land is shaped to\\nconserve moisture. Acceptability of this method is however limited in regions where pressure on land\\ndoes not permit leaving a large area barren for runoff harvesting.\\nCreating micro relief in cultivated field between seed rows to direct rainwater to crop root zone is\\nanother approach. Here, small alternate strips of land of suitable width are left without cropping. These\\nun-cropped strips are ridged up and compacted or shaped to slope towards seed rows to increase runoff,\\nwhich will flow towards cropped strip. The relative width of runoff strip and cropped strip varies from\\n2:1 to 4:1 depending on rainfall. Land shaping through raised ridges between crop rows, planting in\\nshallow ditch or trench, formation of slopping beds towards tree trunk,  saucer shaped basins around\\ntrees, semicircular or crescent shaped basins on the downward slope around trees etc., come under this\\ncategory. The micro watershed methods are also termed as inter-row water harvesting or inter-plot\\nwater harvesting.\\nV. Reduction of loss of stored soil moisture\\nRainfall infiltrates into the soil and permits downward and laterally and gets stored in soil profile. Part\\nof it percolates down to ground water. Stored water is absorbed by plants and weeds. It is lost from the\\nsoil surface as evaporation and from crop and w eed canopy as transpiration. The loss through evapo-\\nration from soil and transpiration by weeds can be checked to reduce loss of stored moisture. Excessive\\ntranspiration loss from crop plants can also be minimized. ET loss is by latent heat of vapourisation and\\nis governed by energy, vapour pressure gradient and conductivity of medium. Evapotranspiration can\\nbe checked by:'),\n",

Reduction of evaporation loss\\nEvaporation happens to maintain soil thermal regime and is governed by soil moisture content, vegeta-\\ntive cover on surface, soil type, temperature gradient between soil and atmosphere and atmospheric\\nwater demand. Higher soil moisture content, especially a wet surface soil increases evaporation rate. As\\nthe surface soil dries up, continuity of capillary pores is disrupted and moisture movement upwards\\nfrom deeper layers is reduced. Soil surface that is exposed to radiation without any vegetative cover\\noffers more scope for evaporation due to over hea ting. Evaporation loss in a cropped field is more in\\nthe early growth stage when canopy cover is less, especially in widely spaced crops and slow growing\\nspecies. V egetative cover prevents direct exposure of soil surface to radiation, reduces heating of soil\\nlayers and thus checks the necessity for evaporation. Black soils tend to absorb more heat and may\\nevaporate more water. When cracks are formed during drying, evaporation takes place from the sides\\nof the cracks also. With high temperature, lo w humidity and dry winds, atmospheric water demand\\nincreases the rate of evaporation.\\n(a) Measures to reduce evaporation loss\\n(i) Shallow surface tillage: When surface soil is stirred by tillage, the continuity of capillary pores\\nis broken and the rise of water through capillary movement is obstructed. Shallow tillage after\\nsummer showers is beneficial in this regard. This process is called dust mulching. Inter tillage\\nbetween crop rows during early dry spells has a similar effect.\\n(ii) Mulching: Mulching means covering the soil surface with any material such as organic wastes,\\nplastic, polythene sheets etc. The organic wastes used for mulching include crop stubbles, straw,\\ncoir pith, groundnut shell, husk etc. These wastes at 5–10 t ha −1 are spread on the soil surface\\nto a thickness of 5-10 cm. Mulching provides the following benefits:\\n\\x7f reduces direct impact of rain drops on soil particles and controls splash erosion.\\n\\x7f increases infiltration.\\n\\x7f reduces velocity of runoff water.\\n\\x7f controls erosion.\\n\\x7f improves soil moisture stor age from rainfall.\\n\\x7f controls evaporation loss.\\n\\x7f suppresses weed growth.\\n\\x7f influences thermal regime of soil by reducing soil temperature.\\n\\x7f improves microbial activity.\\n\\x7f controls salinity development.\\n\\x7f can be incorporated as manures later.\\nVertical mulching is a technique where in trenches of 40 cm wide, 15 cm deep are dug at 2–4 m\\ninterval across slope and filled with stubbles or organic wastes to a height of 10 cm above soil surface.\\nRunoff is checked, collected in the shallow trenches and redistributed to adjoining soil layers.

Stubble mulch is very\\neffectively done in western countries, where crop residue or by products like straw, stover or haulms are\\nnot given to animals as fodder. Special farm implements are available to create minimum disturbance\\nand leave large surface area undisturbed. It also acts as minimum tillage and conservation tillage.\\nPebble mulch where small pebbles like stone are placed on the soil surface. This mulching will be\\nsuccessful in dry land horticulture (fruit tree culture). The pebbles placed on the basins of trees not only\\nreduce evaporation but also facilitate infiltration of rainwater into the basin.\\nUse of anti-evaporating chemicals: Chemicals like hexadecanol are used as anti-evaporants. When\\nsprayed and mixed with soil surface, hexadecanol is reported to reduce evaporation by 43%. The treated\\nsurface layer dries up fast and creates a diffusional barrier for upward movement of water vapour. It is\\nresistant to microbial activity and degradation. It remains in soil for more than a year. It also increased\\nthe soil aggregate stability. Evaporation from free water surface, farm ponds, lakes etc., can be reduced\\nto 80% by wax emulsions, rubber/plastic boats or saw dust.\\nShelter belt: In arid and semiarid regions, the hot winds dry the surface soil and create vapour\\npressure gradient and continuous vapourisation tak es place. This continuous vapourisation can be\\narrested by raising shelterbelt. It is a practice of growing one or multi rows of trees/shrubs or crop plants\\nacross the wind direction either in the field or field boundaries to reduce the wind effect and to reduce\\nthe wind velocity. Shelterbelt reduces the evaporation and increases soil moisture content by 3–5% and\\nthis will be useful to alleviate the terminal moisture stress in crops grown in adjoining area. The\\nincrease in soil moisture percentage is due to favourable microclimate created by shelterbelts. It can be\\nused as resting place of livestock in dry lands. Due to reduction in wind velocity, the pollen drift in\\norchard crops is minimized, there by pollination percentage is increased and fruit setting is improved.\\nMany trees in shelterbelt are economically important. After long period of maintenance, the trees can\\nbe disposed off as timber and raw material for industrial use. Fruit trees grown in shelterbelt give fruits,\\nwhich fetch higher economic returns. Windbreak is also a form of shelter belt, but only one row of tall\\ntrees having good leaf canopy are grown in North-South direction in order to reduce wind velocity and\\nthere by reduce soil erosion. Tall trees like eucal yptus, casuarinas, and wood a pple are grown as wind\\nbreaks. After years of maintenance, these trees can be disposed of economically.\\n(iii) Measures to reduce transpiration loss:  Though transpiration is necessary and unavoidable evil,\\nexcessive transpiration has to be controlled especially when soil moisture stress develops during critical\\nstages of crop growth. The rate of transpiration is governed by soil moisture potential, atmospheric\\nwater demand and plant canopy characters such as leaf area, leaf orientation, stomatal resistance, etc.\\nTranspiration loss can be reduced by the use of antitranspirants and by some cultural methods also.\\nA.

But complete closure of stomata adversely affects gas exchange and photosynthesis.\\nThese chemicals may also cause phyto-toxicity and are very expensive too. E.g.,  Phenyl mercuric\\nacetate (PMA) and alkanyl succinic acid (ASA).\\nFilm forming type: They cover the stomata by forming a thin film over leaf surface. These sub-\\nstances are nontoxic, non-degradable and very easy to apply but they adversely affect photosynthesis.\\nE.g., Paraffin and wax emulsions, folic 2%, and power oil 1%.\\nReflectant type: When sprayed on leaf surface, the reflectant type antitranspirants increase the leaf\\nalbedo or leaf reflectance of sunlight. As a result, heating is reduced, leaf temperature inside is low and\\nneed for transpiration is reduced. E.g., Kaolin and lime solution. Spraying kaolin at 3–6% concentration\\nreduced leaf temperature by 3–4 °C and transpiration by 22–28%. These are less expensive, non phy-\\ntotoxic and do not interfere with photosynthesis, since stomatal closure does not take place.\\nGrowth retardant type: Chemicals like cycocel (ccc-chloro choline chloride, chlor mequat) when\\nsprayed on foliage, reduce leaf area and thereby reduce the transpiring area and transpiration.\\nB. Cultural methods\\n(a) Weed control:  Most weeds have a high transpiration coefficient i.e., amount of water transpired\\nto produce unit quantity of dry matter. Early weed control prevents unwanted transpiration loss\\nthrough weeds.\\n(b) Shelterbelts : Rows of trees grown across the direction of wind reduce air movement, reduce\\ntemperature of air and plant canopy, increase humidity in the protected strips and thereby reduce\\nthe atmospheric water demand and control transpiration in the inter space between shelterbelts.\\n(c) Alley cropping:  This practice refers to raising perennial shrubs or tall crops as hedge rows up to\\n1-2 m height at 48 m intervals and raising short stature annual crops in the alleys (inter space\\nbetween hedge rows). A similar effect on reduction in atmospheric water demand and transpi-\\nration as described under shelterbelts is caused in alley cropping.

Choice of crops\\nTraditional cropping pattern in the dry farmi ng areas is dominated by food grains  viz. , millets and\\npulses. In a predominantly subsistence type of farming system, such dominance of food crops is natu-\\nral. The choice of crops for dry lands is affected by  rainfall quantity and distribution, time of onset of\\nmonsoon, duration of monsoon, soil characters including amount of rainwater stored in the soil and\\nfarmer’s requirements.

Selection of suitable varieties\\nIn dry farming regions, traditional local crop va rieties still dominate. The preference for these local\\nvarieties is based on their pronounced drought tolerance. But they are usually longer in duration sus-\\nceptible to moisture stress at maturity. They have low yield potential even under favourable rainfall.\\nThey do not respond significantly to improved manag ement such as nutrient supply.

Intercropping\\nIntercropping refers to growing two or more crops in the same field during the same season. Intercropping\\nis widely practiced in dry farming since it offers many advantages. Intercropping is a risk minimization\\nstrategy and provides an insurance against complete crop failure due to rainfall abnormalities. This is\\nmade possible through the duration difference between component crops. It provides more yield and\\nincome per unit area per unit time than sole cropping. Stability in production is achieved. Multiple\\nproducts for home consumption as well as for marketing are made available. When legumes are in-\\ncluded in intercropping, soil fertility is enriched. Intercrop canopy suppresses weed growth. Some\\nintercrop combinations provide biological control of pests and diseases ( e.g.,) cotton + cluster bean\\ncropping system. Intercrop cluster bean reduces jassid incidence in cotton. Resource use efficiency is\\nincreased viz., light, water and nutrients are efficiently used. However, for success in intercropping, the\\ncompetition between component crops must be minimized and the complimentary effects must be\\nmaximized. This can be accomplished by the following means;\\n\\x7f Choice of suitable component crops differing in dur ation, rooting pattern, canopy architecture,\\nnutrient requirement and occurrence of critical stages\\n\\x7f Selection of genotypes in each component crop\\n\\x7f Optimum population of component crops\\n\\x7f Suitable crop geometry to provide adequate space for intercrops\\n\\x7f Preference for leguminous crops as intercrops\\nThe important intercropping systems suitable for dry lands are given in Table 13.9.\\nTable 13.9.

It is the process\\nof soaking seeds in chemical solution and drying to induce tolerance to drought. Soil moisture stress\\nimmediately after sowing affects germination and establishment. Seed hardening enables seedlings to\\nsurvive this early moisture stress. During seed hardening, seeds are subjected to partial hydration\\nfollowed by dehydration before sowing. Seeds are soaked for specified time in chemical solutions of\\nprescribed concentration. Soaked seeds are then dried in shade back to original moisture content.\\nDuring soaking, seeds imbibe water and germination process is started but not completed. The hard-\\nened seeds are thus in a ready state for germina tion. When sown in mo ist soils, seeds ger minate\\nimmediately. Such early ge rmination helps in seedling emergence before surface soil dries up.\\nThe seed hardening ensures early germination by 2–3 days compared to untreated seeds and induces\\nbetter root development, which enables absorption of more moisture. Germination and seedling emergence\\nare completed before surface soil dries out. It induces drought tolerance by increasing the resistance to\\nprotoplasmic dehydration in young seedlings subjected to moisture stress. Hardened seeds can be sown\\nimmediately or within 30 days of treatment. The seed hardening is considered as low cost technology and\\nis the most important requirement for pre-monsoon sowing. For success in seed hardening, attention must\\nbe paid in selection of right chemical, its concentration, time of soaking, volume of solution and drying\\nunder shade to original moisture content. The seed hardening for various crops is given in Table 13.12.\\nFor pulses (black gram/green gram), 4 kg of wood ash is collected, powdered thoroughly to which\\n30% Acacia gum is added and mixed thoroughly so that wood ash-gum paste is obtained. 8 kg of black\\ngram or green gram seed is spread over the Acacia-wood ash paste and mixed thoroughly so that all the\\nseeds are smeared with the paste. The treated seeds ar e shade dried for 5 hours and then can be sown.\\n(b) Sowing at optimum soil moisture: An effective rainfall of 20–25 mm, which can wet a depth\\nof 10–15 cm, is needed for sowing. Moisture stress at or immediately after sowing adversely affects\\ngermination and establishment of seedlings. To ensure adequate soil moisture at sowing, sowing has\\nto be done as early as possible after soaking rainfall is received. Sowing methods and implements play\\na crucial role in this regard.\\n(c) Time of sowing: Optimum time of sowing is indicated by adequate rainfall to wet seeding depth\\nand continuity of rainfall after sowing.

Factors Influencing NUE\\nNutrient use efficiency (NUE) refers to the yield per kg of nutrient applied. The response of rainfed\\ncrops to nutrient application depends on crop and variety, rainfall and soil moisture availability, soil\\nproperties, quantity, time and methods of nutrient application, cr opping system adopted and manage-\\nment practices such as moisture conservation, timely weed control etc. The following Table 83 gives the\\nresponse of rainfed crops to nutrients-nitrogen and phosphorus.\\nTable 13.16.

If continuity and assurance of rainfall in early growth\\nstage is present, then top dressing would be beneficial. Since, high intensity of rainfall is common in\\ndry lands, split application of N would be advantageous to prevent loss through leaching. Information\\non rainfall probability could be used in scheduling fertilizer application to suit moisture storage capacity\\nof soil profile and progress of rainfall during cropping season.\\n(b) Crop and variety: Crops and varieties vary in their ability to use applied nutrients. Hybrids and\\nhigh yielding varieties (HYV) respond better than local varieties because of their high yield potential\\nat the same level of resource supply. Among the crops, response to individual nutrients varies with\\nspecies. Cereals and millets respond more to N, legumes to P 2O5 and oilseeds to N, P 2O5 and K 2O.\\n(c) Soil properties: Soil physical properties influence crop response mainly by affecting soil mois-\\nture availability. Soil nutrient status also has a significant effect on crop response. Dry lands are mostly\\ndeficient in N and so, there is universal response to N. Response to P2O5 depends on fixation in soil and\\nto K on leaching loss.\\n(d) Management practices: Nutrient management aspects such as quantity, time and method of\\napplication of nutrients, inclusion of le gumes in cropping system, soil moisture conservation practices\\netc. also influence crop response to nutrients.\\nD. Integrated Nutrient Management (INM)\\nThe components of INM for rainfed crops are organic manures, inorganic fertilizers, biofertilizers and\\ninclusion of legumes\\n1. Organic manures\\nOrganic matter content in dryland soils is low and its improvement is essential to promote soil moisture\\nstorage and nutrient supply. This can be accomplished through addition of FYM/compost, green manure/\\ngreen leaf manures and crop residues. Addition of FYM/compost at 12.5 t/ha is recommended.\\nIncorporation of green manures/GLM before sowing or incorporation of intercropped legumes is useful.\\nAt Kovilpatti, Tamil Nadu, incorporation of sunn hemp not only reduced 50% N requirement but also\\nsustained yield in cotton, sunflower and improved physico-chemical properties of soil.

To avoid fixation of applied P,\\napplication as enriched FYM is recommended. Deep placement is important for post rainy season crops\\ngrown on stored moisture. K is applied basally at  last ploughing and incorporated. Micronutrients are\\napplied after sowing but not incorporated. Use of seed cum fertilizer drill is very useful for placement\\nof fertilizers\\nTime of application should be such to suit crop requirement and moisture availability. Since adequate\\nmoisture is always available at sowing, basal application is effective. N can be top-dressed at\\n25–30 DAS depending on rainfall. This enables skipping fertilizer if rainfall is not adequate and save\\nthe cost. For millets and cotton ½ N and full P and K are applied basally and ½ N is top-dressed. For\\nother crops, full NPK is applied basally. For pre-monsoon sown crops like cotton and sorghum, entire\\nP can be applied basally as enriched FYM. In case of sorghum, entire N can be applied at 30-35 DAS\\nand for cotton, N can be applied in two equal splits at 20–25 and 40–45 DAS depending upon the\\nreceipt of rainfall during the corresponding period.\\n3. Legumes in cropping system\\nLegume intercropping is very common in dry lands. When a short duration legume is intercropped with\\na long duration non-legume, the legume haulms after picking pods can be incorporated to benefit the\\nnon-legume by current transfer of legume fixed N. In Sequential cropping, short duration legumes\\ngrown for grain/fodder as first crop, enrich the soil and the residual effect benefits the succeeding crop.\\n4. Biofertilisers\\nSeed inoculation of legumes with rhizobium, and seed inoculation and soil application with azospirillum\\nfor cereals, millets, cotton, sunflower and sesamum is recommended. Besides N fixation, azospirillum\\nimproves root growth through the exudation of growth promoting substances. Use of phosphobacteria\\nas seed inoculation and soil application for solubilising native P is also recommended. V A mycorrhizae\\nis found to play a crucial role in P nutrition of dry land crops especially soybean, sorghum and pearl\\nmillet.

Dry Land Horticulture\\nFruit trees with drought tolerance potential can substitute annual crops in many dry land tracts. The\\ncriteria for selection of fruit trees for dry lands are drought tolerance, adaptability to varying soil\\nconditions, flowering and fruiting during period of adequate moisture availability, quick regeneration\\nafter pruning and rapid recovery after stress is removed. The Table 13.17 gives an idea to go for fruit\\ntrees under different rainfall and soil type conditions.\\nSuccessful dry land horticulture depends on many cultural requirements  viz. , selection of trees\\nsuitable for rainfall and soil, planting during monsoon season in one m 3 pits, pot watering during hot\\nmonths in the early establishment period of 2–3 years, pruning to reduce canopy during dry season and\\nmoisture conservation through vegetative barriers, large basins sloping towards tree trunk, crescent or\\nsaucer shape basins, mulching with dry leaves, straw or crop waste.\\nTable 13.17.

In some instances, cropping has been\\ngiven up altogether and lands remain fallow and become wastelands overgrown with unwanted vegetation.\\nTo arrest this trend and to bring back the land under economically useful vegetation, alternate land use\\nsystems such as grasslands/pastures, agroforestry and horticulture are recommended. This has become\\nnecessary for the following reasons:\\n\\x7f Annual field crop production is non viable and uneconomical in many years.\\n\\x7f Yield of field crops is low and fluctuates w idely between years affecting stability and income.\\n\\x7f Continued use of the eroded and degraded lands under the present system of annual cropping\\nmay ecologically degrade the lands further aff ecting sustainability of the fragile eco-system in\\nthe dry lands, leading to the creation of wastelands.\\n\\x7f Alternate land use systems such as grasslands and tr ee culture are less risk y, more productive\\nand remunerative in these marginal lands. They will provide stability and sustainability.\\nThe choice of an alternate land use system depends on the land capability. Most of the lands under\\ndry farming tracts come under the land ca pability classes of III and above.\\nLand capability class Alternate land use recommended\\nClass II Dry land horticulture\\nClass III and IV Agro-forestry/ley farming\\nClass V Pastures/silvipasture/tree farming\\nClass VI Range lands/wood lots\\nA.

E.g., Palmyrah, Neem, Tamarind, Eucalyptus.\\n(ii) Different systems of tree culture\\n1. Agrisilviculture (Agroforestry ): Trees and annual crops ar e raised in an intercropping system\\nin the same field. Trees are planted at 5-8 m spacing and field crops are sown in the interspaces\\nduring rainy reason. E.g., Leucaena + sorghum/pearl millet/castor/pulses, neem/vagai + fodder\\nsorghum/pulses.\\n2. Silvipasture:  Leguminous fodder trees are raised with fodder grasses and legumes as intercrops.\\nE.g., acacia + cenchrus + stylosanthes, vagai/sisoo + cenchrus + stylosanthes.\\n3. Alley cropping or hedgerow intercropping:  Annual field crops are grown in alleys formed by\\nhedgerows of trees and shrubs. The trees or shrubs in hedge rows are cut back to short height\\n(0.5–1.0 m) at sowing of annual crops with onset of rains and kept pruned during crop growing\\nseason to reduce shade effect and competition with field crops. The width of alley (space between\\nhedges) is about 4–6 m. e.g., leucaena or desmanthus as hedge row with sorghum, maize, pigeon\\npea and sunflower as intercrop. Alley cropping offers many benefits.\\n\\x7f Green fodder from hedgerows during dry season, and food and dry fodder from annual\\ncrops during rainy season.\\n\\x7f Off season rainfall is utilized by hedgerow trees or shrubs.\\n\\x7f Hedge rows check runoff and erosion when formed along contour or across slope.\\n\\x7f Loppings and prunings from hedgerows can be used as fodder, fuel wood or for mulching.\\n\\x7f Yield of crops raised in the alleys is improved due to better micr oclimate through reduction\\nin temperature and wind speed, increase in humidity and reduction in evapotranspiration\\nloss.\\nSuccess in alley cropping depends on alley width and height of hedgerows. Alley width of 5–6 m\\nhas been found to be effective. Low height of 45–50 cm is desirable. Usually one cutting of hedgerow\\nshrubs at the time of sowing of annual crops and subsequent prunings at monthly interval during\\ncropping season are optimal. During dry season, cutting is done depending on fodder requirement.\\n4. Timber-Fibre system (TIMFIB system):  It involves growing trees and perennial fibre crops\\ntogether. E.g., Leucaena + agave.\\n(iii) Choice of trees for dry lands\\nTrees suitable for dry lands must have the characters like multipurpose tree species (fodder, fuel,\\ntimber, wood), adaptable to wide variations in soil and climate, rapid growth and withstanding against\\nsevere pruning.\\n13.11 WATERSHED DEVELOPMENT\\nWatershed is defined as a natural hydrological unit that covers a specific land surface area from which\\nrunoff passes through a common outlet.

Need and Advantages\\nWatershed is an acceptable basic hydrolog ical unit of planning for optimum use and conservation of\\nsoil and water resources. Here, development is not confined to agricultural land alone but covers the\\nwhole land area starting from the highest point of the watershed (ridge line) to the lower most point of\\noutlet into the natural drainage stream at the bottom of the slope. It means every part of land including\\nbarren, sloppy and marginal lands being treated accor ding to its capability. By adopting watershed as\\nunit for development, different measures are adopted and executed in each of the topo-sequence accord-\\ning to its capability, providing an integrated treatment of arable and non-arable lands.\\ne.g.,\\nRidge line Tree culture\\nMarginal land Agroforestry, pasture\\nArable land Integrated soil and moisture conservation and cropping\\nIt aims at comprehensive development of all resources in the watershed i.e., holistic. It starts from\\nthe most important resources viz., soil and water and extends to other resources like crops trees, live-\\nstock etc. Some of the resource conservation measures may have to be carried out cutting across field\\nboundaries E.g., Contour bunding, contour vegetative barriers, shelterbelts, drainage channel. For this,\\nwatershed is more ideal unit.

Sometimes,  harvesting time may also coincide with heavy rainfall or\\nsevere cyclone and floods. In view of these situations suitable technology is, therefore, necessary for\\nreducing the harvesting time and safe storage at farm level. The post-harvest losses are estimated to be\\nabout 25 per cent.\\nPost-harvest operations are assuming importance due to higher yields and increased cropping\\nintensity. Due to introduction of modern technology, yield levels have substantially increased resulting\\nin a marketable surplus, which has to be stored till prices are favorable for sale. With increase in\\nirrigation facilities and easy availability of fertilizers, intensive cropping is being practiced. A recent\\nestimate by the Ministry of Food and Civil supplies put the total preventable post-harvest losses of food\\ngrains at about 20 million tons a year, which was nearly 10 per cent of the total production. The\\nprincipal adviser, planning commission stated that food grains wasted during post-harvest period could\\nhave fed up 117 million people for a year.\\nOut of the total food grain production, more than 70 per cent is with the farmer and rest is stored\\nby governmental organizations like central Warehousing Corporation and Food Corporation of India\\nand Traders. The godowns are the most common structures for above ground bag storage. The godowns\\nhave all the facilities for fumigation, providing aer ation and rat proof. Each  of the godown can hold\\n5000 t of bagged food grains. Grain is also stored in bulk using large silos. For want of required storage\\nspace in godowns, food grains are also stored in the open and this method of storage is known as CAP\\nstorage. Cap stands for cover and plinth. Open spaces in warehouses and elsewhere are used for storing\\nproduce. Crates are placed on floor, mats are spread on the crates and finally bags are placed over the\\ncrates. The stacks are built in the farm of domes. As protection against rain and sun the stacks are\\ncovered with thick (600 to 1000 gua ge) black polythene sheets and the cover is tied to the stack with\\nthe help of plastic ropes.\\n14.1 HARVESTING\\nRemoval of entire plant or economic parts after maturity from the field is called harvesting. It includes\\nthe operation of cutting, picking, plucking or digging or a combination of these for removing the useful\\npart or economic part from the plants/crops. The portion of the stem that is left in the field after harvest\\nis called as stubble. The economic product may be grain, seed, leaf, root or entire plant.'),\n",

Example–HCN\\ntoxin content in sorghum is high up to 30–45 DAS.\\nF. Methods of Harvesting\\nHarvesting is done either manually or by mechanical means.\\n(i) Manual: Sickle is the important tool used for harvesting. The sickle has to be sharp, curved and\\nserrated for efficient harvesting. Knife is used for harvesting of plants with thick and woody\\nstems. Now-a-days improved type of sickle is available which reduce the drudgery of harvesting\\nlabourers.\\n(ii) Mechanical: Harvesting with the use of implements or machines.\\nG. Implements/Machinery used for Threshing and Drying\\nFor harvesting: Power tiller operator paddy harvester , combine harvester, guntaka etc. are used.\\n(i) Paddy harvester: It is used for non-lodging varieties.  During operation, the nose of the har-\\nvester first enters into the standing crop and movement brings the crop between star projection\\nof the wheel, then it cuts the standing crop. Capacity of this machine is one hectare per day. The\\nwidth of the coverage for one movement will be 0.75 m. The power requirement is 3 H.P. The\\npresent cost of the unit will be Rs. 30,000 and operation cost is Rs. 260/ha including cost of two\\nlabourers.\\n(ii) Combine harvester: It is possible to harvest and thresh the produce simultaneously using\\ncombine harvester. It cuts the crop, separates the grain from straw, cleans it from chaff and dust\\nand stores the grains in the storage tank. The combine harvester reaps 2–9 rows at a time\\ndepending on its size and is equipped with 8 to 10 H.P engine. The cutting operation is done by\\na reciprocating type of cutter bar with a speed of 800–900 strokes per minute. The cut portion\\nis transferred to conveyor belt or plant form with the help of wheel. Threshing cylinders operating\\nat a peripheral speed of 800–1200 stroked per minute are used for threshing. Grain and chaff are\\nseparated with the help of blowers.\\n(iii) Guntaka:  Ground nut is harvested using heavy blade harrows called Guntakas–R.E.

Sunflower and safflower, which are difficult to\\nthresh with traditional methods, can also be threshed by the multi-crop thresher.\\n(iv) Rollers: Rollers made of stone are used to thresh grains from ears of millets like ragi, sorghum\\nand cumbu. Ear heads are spread to a thickness of 20 cm in a circular fashion on a threshing\\nfloor and rollers are drawn over it by a pair of bullocks.\\nDrying is done either by using solar energy or by artificial heating (mechanical drying) of air and\\ncirculating it as in driers.\\nStorage - Harvesting of crop is seasonal, but consumption of food grain is continuous. The market\\nvalue of the produce is generally low at harv esting time. So the grower need storage facility to hold a\\nportion of produce to meet the feed and seed requirements in addition of selling surplus produce when\\nthe marketing price is favourable. Traders and Co-operatives at market centres need storage structures\\nto hold grains when the transport facility is inadequate. The government also needs storage structures\\nto maintain buffer reserves to offset the effects produced by the vagaries of nature. Hence, there is\\nnecessity to store the produce for different periods primarily for commercial reasons. The growers,\\nprocessors, transporters and warehouse men have to develop storage facilities for proper storage of food\\ngrains, oilseeds, commercial crops like Chillies, vegetables and fruits etc., and seeds intended for\\nsowing in the following seasons. An ideal storage facility should satisfy the following requirements:\\n\\x7f It should provide maximum possible protection from ground moisture, rains, insect pests, moulds,\\nrodents, birds, fire, etc.\\n\\x7f It should provide the necessary facility for inspection, disinfection, loading, unloading, cleaning\\nand reconditioning.\\n\\x7f It should protect grain from excessive moisture and temperature favourable to both insect and\\nmould development.\\n\\x7f It should be economical and suitable for a particular situation.\\nH. Post Harvest Processing\\nPost harvest processing encompasses an array of handling and processing system from the stage of\\nmaturation till consumption of the produce and includes threshing, cleaning, grading, drying, parboiling,\\ncuring, milling, preservation, storage, processing, packaging, transportation, marketing and consumption\\nsystems.\\nThe most important factor deciding the storability of the produce is moisture content of the produce.\\nHigh moisture content invites pest and disease and induce pre-g ermination. Moisture content for safe\\nstorage of grains of most crops is about 14% (raw rice), 15% for parboiled rice, 12% for wheat, barley,\\nother millets and pulses, 10% for coriander, ch illies and 6% for groundnut, rapeseed and mustard.\\nI.

The most important change during parboiling is the gelatinization of\\nstarch and disintegration of protein bodies in the endosperm.\\n(iv) Milling: Refers to the size reduction and separation operations used for processing of food\\ngrains into edible form by removing and separating the inedible and undesirable portions from\\nthem, Milling may involve cleaning/separating husk (dehusking), sorting, whitening, polishing,\\ngrinding etc.\\n(v) Storage: Proper storage in storage structures is necessary to prevent the grains from storage pest\\nand to maintain the quality of seeds.\\nIII. Methods involved in Post Harvest Technology\\nThe quantitative losses encountered at various stages ar e 1 to 3%, during harvest, 2 to 6% during\\nthreshing, 1 to 5% during drying 2 to 7% during handling 2 to 10% during milling and 2 to 6% during\\nhandling 2 to 10% during milling and 2 to 6% during stor age. To overcome these losses the following\\nimproved practices can be adopted.\\n(i) Harvesting: Paddy if not harvested at the optimum time, results in loss of quality and quantity.\\nTo reduce these losses, machines like combines and reapers are being introduced to harvest\\npaddy at an appropriate stage.\\n(ii) Threshing: Threshing, done by bullocks, tractors and by hand, result in poor drying, storage and\\nmilling. The multicrop threshers have been developed to reduce these losses.\\n(iii) Transport: Poor transport facilities result in losses to the farmers, millers, and eventually food\\ngrain to the country, sometimes as much as 2–3 per cent. Good transport facilities should be used\\nto minimize these losses. When once the grain is threshed and dried, it will be transported from\\nthe field to store houses by bullock carts, or tractors by the growers. Sometimes if the market\\nprice is favourable, the produce is disposed to the traders soon after drying. The disposal of the\\nproduce, either at the village or at the market yard is, however often closely connected with\\nfinancial needs of the growers and sometimes indebtedness. The traders on purchasing, transport\\nthe produce to go-down, or shops for sale to the consumers. This transport mainly uses trucks\\ni.e., lorries. Government agencies like Food Corporation of India etc., transport the produce\\nfrom one place to another place either by road or rail (waggons) for long-term storage and\\nsometimes to export to other countries by sea (cargo). If the produce is not properly bagged and\\nhandled there will be some loss during transport.\\n(iv) Drying: Sun drying methods cause more breakage of grain than other factor, resulting in low\\nhead yields and low milling yields. Moist paddy in storage deteriorates rapidly. With the intro-\\nduction of heated air dryers, the losses can be reduced considerably.\\n(v) Storage: Uncleaned wet paddy accounts for the largest losses during storage. This is followed\\nby losses due to rodents, bir ds, mould, fungus, insects and pilferage. These losses can be mini-\\nmized by storing in good storage structures.'),\n",

Types of storage\\nHolding grain in bulk in underground is an age-old method of rural storage. Wheat, rice, sorghum,\\nfinger millet, etc., can be stored underground for a period of 2 years. These structures are simple\\nunderground dig-outs upto a depth of 5 m varying in sizes to hold from a small quantity upto 50 t. The\\npits are lined with brick or concrete so that moisture from walls and bottom does not damage the grain.\\nAt the time of filling a layer of straw is placed on all sides. After the pit is filled, straw is spread over\\nthe grain and then topped with a layer of soil. Insect infestation is less in the underground storage and\\nit is cheaper over above grou nd storage structures. This underground structure is not suitable for high\\nrainfall and high water-table areas. Further the grain stored underground has poor appearance and\\nmusty smell. Several types of above ground storage structures mentioned below are also in use in our\\ncountry,\\n(i) Mud Bins: The mud bins are made of unburnt clay mi xed with straw with 1-3 inch thick wall\\nand are oval, rectangular or circular. A small hole is provided at the base for taking out the grain\\nand a larger hole is provided at the top for filling it with grain. Both the inlet and outlet holes\\nare plugged while grain is stored.\\n(ii) Straw bins: For storing paddy in humid zones, dried plants are used for making temporary\\nstructures, which after being filled with grain are further reinforced from outside by winding\\npaddy straw ropes around the whole structure. Each structure holds 2-6 quintals of grain.\\n(iii) Bukhari bins: This is a cylindrical structure and is made of mud and split bamboo’s. The bin is\\nalways placed on a wooden or a massonary plat form to prevent its contact with the ground. The\\ncapacity may vary from 3–10 t.\\n(iv) Kothar type bins: These bins are very much similar to a timber box placed on a raised plat\\nform, which is generally supported on pillars. Both the floor and walls are made of wooden\\nplanks, where the tiled or thatched roof is placed over it as a protection against sun and rains.\\nThe capacity may vary from 9–35 t.\\n(v) Metal bins: Bins made of steel, alluminium R.C.C. are used for storage of grains outside the\\nhouse. These bins are fire and mo isture proof. The bins ha ve long durability and produced on\\ncommercial scale. The capacity ranges from 1 to 10 t. Silos are huge bins made with either steel,\\nalluminium or concrete. Usually steel and allum inium bins are circular in shape. The capacity\\nof silo ranges from 500 to 4000 t. A silo has facilities for loading and unloading grains.\\nThe storage structures in rural areas are not ideal from scientific-storage point of view, as substan-\\ntial losses occur during storage of grain from insect pests,  moulds, rodents, etc.; keeping the require-\\nments of the farmers in view the Indian grain storage institute (IGSI), Hapur with its branch at Ludhiana'),\n",

Methods of storage\\nThe grains are stored at three different levels, viz ., at the producer’s level (rural storage) trader’s level\\nand urban organizational storage. The urban organization uses modern facilities and structures like\\nsilos, warehouses and also undertaken periodical inspection,  processing and treatment of grains for\\nensuring their quality during storage. Generally, there are two ways of storing grains i.e., Storage in\\nbags and loose or bulk storage. In the tropical regi ons, the grain is stored in bags. Storage in bags\\nrequires considerable labour, but the minimum investment is enough on permanent structures and\\nequipment. The storage in bags has the advantage of being short-term storage. Bag storage can be done\\nunder a roof of Galvanized Iron sheets, a plastic covering where grain is intended for very early onward\\nmovement. Usually no control measures against insects are needed for short-ter m storage. If bag stor-\\nage produce is intended for long time, the control measures have to be taken against insect pests. The\\nbulk storage has an advantage of greater storage capacity per unit volume of space. Less labour is\\ninvolved in loading and unloading and there is no need of investment in purchasing gunny bags. In bulk\\nstorage the insect infestation is also lower over bag storag e. The grain can be kept for several years in\\nbulk storage.\\n(vi) Parboiling: It is done by soaking the grain in large concrete tanks and steaming it in small\\nkettles or Soaking and steaming grain in large metal tanks with a boiler. The old traditional\\nmethods of parboiling incur physical losses and excessive cost of operation. Modern parboiling\\ntechnologies have been developed and widely accepted by millers with good success leading\\nreduction in losses.\\n(vii) Milling: Traditional milling equipment has the lowest milling recovery. With modernization of rice\\nmilling industry and by replacing hullers with modern mills, the milling losses can be reduced.\\nThe qualitative losses like change in colour, odour, vitamins, texture are due to over exposure\\nto sun, fungal growth and insect attack. These losses can also be controlled by proper handling,\\ndrying and storage after harvest.\\n(viii) Marketing: In general most of the producers sell the grains at their door steps in villages, to\\navoid transport. At village level defective measures and weights are used by traders and also the\\nprices paid to farmers are much lower than re gulated market rates. No w-a-days farmers are\\nencouraged to sell their produce in near by regula ted markets, though some labour is involved\\nin transport. In regulated markets some amenities are pr ovided for sellers and the growers can\\nsecure maximum value for their produce. In market yards several methods like cover system,\\nopen system and auction system are adopted depending on the type of produce sold. Since the\\nrural banking system is improved the farmers to a large extent they are out of clutches of greedy\\nprivate money lenders who exert pressure to dispose produce for lower price. At present in some\\nplaces the cold storage facilities are also available. Farmers can utilize these cold storage facili-\\nties for stocking their produce on payment of rent and the produce can be disposed when there\\nis remunerative price in the market. Though several measures are taken by government the\\nmarketing of agricultural produce is facing problems and growers are not getting the reasonable\\nprice for their produce. If production exceeds demand, price declines until the market is cleared.\\nPrices raise when production fell short. Responses to lower or higher prices occur in the next\\nproduction cycle. Therefore, the acreage for a particular crop based on demand and the support-\\ning prices for each commodity need to be monitored by the rulers based on demand and supply'),\n",

Low Cost Post Harvest Technology\\nThese are some of the technologies suitable for small farmers:\\n1. Solar Dryers: Drying is the cheapest mode of preservation of fruits, vegetables and other items\\nlike fish. Solar drying is practiced by mankind since times in memorable. This method of drying\\nwith solar energy is ideally practiced by many grape growers in Maharashtra to make Kishmish/\\nManuka/Bedana from grapes.\\n2. Zero energy cold storage: Many farmers cultivate fruits and ve getables, which are seasonal in\\nnature. Produce of all the farmers come to the market yard at one go. As a result prices fall. There\\nis a good technology catching up. This is Zero energy cold storage. Everybody knows water\\nbecomes cool in an earthen pot. The water oozing out of the pot gets evaporated. While this\\nevaporation occurs, water inside the pot becomes cold this principle is called as evaporate\\ncooling. This principle is used for zero energy cold storage. Just make a double walled room.\\nKeep sand between the outer and inner wall. Keep the sand wet by watering. And your produce\\nkept inside the inner room will be preserved longer. Government is giving subsidy to popularize\\nthis concept.\\n3. Pickles: Pickling is one of the cheapest process of preser vation of fruits and vegetables. Com-\\nmon salt and spices are used in conventional pickles. The process of pickling does not need\\nenergy. The process is so efficient that many people make pickles in their houses, which last\\neven two to three years. And that too without any chemical preservatives. Pickled items are\\npreserved because of fermentation.\\n4. Fruit juices: We can make juice from various fruits like Mango, Pineapple, Grapes, Lemons,\\ntomatoes and many types of local specialties like Kokam, Jamun etc. Even Banana and Guava\\njuice can be made. Banana, which is considered as poor man’s fruit in India is considered as rich\\nman’s fancy in countries like Korea and Japan. We can make pulps out of he juices and use in\\noff-season.\\n5. Preservations in salt solutions:  Keeping in salt solutions can preserve vegetables. This process\\ncan be used to prolong the shelf life of various vegetables like cabbage, okra, spinach etc. In this\\nprocess vegetables are kept in salt solutions and bottled. While using, just wash the vegetables\\nin water to remove salt solutions. Shelf life will vary according to various factors but you can\\nprolong shelf life at least by one month in this process. Calcutta University has done consider-\\nable research in this field.\\n6. Small-scale industry in farm:  Farmers cannot get price for their produce because they have to\\ndepend upon middlemen for marketing. There is a solution to the problem. Y ou can start manu-\\nfacturing ketchups, sauces of various types and also Paste of Garlic, Ginger, Chilly etc. With a\\nsmall investment in machinery and building, a unit can work profitably. The unit may give\\nemployment to others with a small investment of only 10 lakhs.\\nIt can be stated with more confidence that such low cost technologies are more successful because\\nthere is more involvement of entrepreneurs in their projects.'),\n",

In some countries, attractive\\nready to eat products, which have, long shelf life e.g. popped and puffed rice, instant or rice flakes,\\ncanned rice and fermented products are produced. Protein is present in aleuron and endosperm (6–9%)\\nand average is 7.5%. Rice straw is used as cattle feed, used for thatching roof and in cottage industry\\nfor preparation of hats, mats, ropes, sound absorbing straw board and used as litter material. Rice husk\\nis used as animal feed, for papermaking and as fuel source. Rice bran is used as cattle and poultry feed\\nand defatted bran, which is rich in protein,  can be used in the preparation of biscuits. Rice bran oil is\\nused in soap industry. Refined oil can be used as a cooling medium like cotton seed oil/corn oil. Rice\\nbran wax, a byproduct of rice bran oil is used in industries. Rice bran oil is available in the market in\\nthe name of Porna for edible purpose (no cholesterol).\\nA. Origin\\nDe Candolle (1886) and Watt (1862) thought that South India was the place where cultivated rice is\\noriginated. V avilov (1926) suggested that India and Burma should be the origin of cultivated crop.\\nB. Species\\nRice belongs to genus Oryza and family Poaceae. The genus includes 24 species of which O. sativa and\\nO. glaberrima are cultivated. O. sativa has three sub species viz., Indica, Japanica and Javanica.\\n1. Indica: Indigenous to India. It is adapted to subtropical-tropical regions. In India, the varieties\\nare very tall, photosensitive, lodging, poor fertilizer responsive, moderate filling and late matur-\\ning. The morphological differences between the varieties are very wide and awnless.\\n2. Japanica: It is confined to subtropical temperate regions (Japan, China, and Korea).

The Tamil\\nNadu district wise area, production and pr oductivity of rice is given in appendix.\\nE. Climate and Soil\\nRice can be grown in different locations under a variety of climate. T he Indica varieties are widely\\ngrown in tropical regions. Japonicas, which are adapted to cooler areas, are largely grown in temperate\\ncountries. Both Indica and Japanica rice varieties are grown in subtropical regions. However, the crosses\\nbetween Indica and Japanica are grown through out the world. Rice needs hot and humid climate. It is\\nbest suited to regions, which have high humid ity, prolonged sunshine and an assured supply of water.\\nTemperature, solar radiation and rainfall influence rice yield by directly affecting the physiological\\nprocesses involved in grain production and indirectly through diseases and pests.\\n(a) Temperature: Extreme temperatures are destructive to plant growth and hence depended on the\\nenvironment under which the life cycle of the rice plant can be completed. The critical low and high\\ntemperatures for rice are normally below 20°C and above 30°C respectively, which vary from one\\ngrowth stage to another. Temperature affects the grain yield by affecting tillering, spikelet formation\\nand ripening and it influences the growth rate just after ger mination and increases almost linearly with\\nincreasing temperature within a range of 22–31°C. At la ter stages, it slightly affects tillering rate and\\nthe relative growth rate. During reproductive stage, the spikelet number per plant increases as the\\ntemperature drops. The critical temperatures for different growth stages of rice are given in Table 15.4.\\nTable 15.4. Temperature Requirement for different Stages of Rice Crop\\nGrowth stage Temperature °C\\nLow Medium High\\nGermination 10 45 20–35\\nSeedling and emergence 12–13 35 20–30\\nRooting 16 35 25–28\\nLeaf elongation 7–12 35 31\\nTillering 9–16 33 25–31\\nPanicle initiation 15 – –\\nAnthesis 22 35 30–33\\nRipening 12–18 30 20–25\\n(b) Solar radiation: The solar radiation requirements of rice crop differ from one growth stage to\\nanother. Shading during vegetative stage slightly affects yield and yield components. Shading during\\nreproductive stage has a pronounced effect on spikelet number. During ripening, it reduces grain yield\\nconsiderably because of decrease in the percentage of filled spikelets. Solar radiation at the reproduc-\\ntive stage has the greatest effect on grain yield. The minimum requirement of solar radiation is\\n300 cal/cm2/day.'),\n",

Long day prevents or delays flowering. E.g., GEB 24 is\\na photosensitive and season bound variety. However the latest varieties released are photo insensitive.\\n(d) Rainfall: Under rainfed rice culture, rainfall is the most limiting factor in rice cultivation. When\\nirrigation is provided, the growth and yield is determined by temperature and solar radiation. Water\\nstress at any growth stage may reduce the yield. The rice plant is most sensitive to water deficit from\\nthe reduction division stage to heading.\\n(e) Wind: Moderate wind is beneficial for crop growth. High wind at maturity may cause lodging\\nof the crop.\\n(f) Soils: Rice is a semi aquatic plant and grows best under low land condition. In India, it grows\\nin all most all type of soils; alluvial, red, lateritic, laterite, black, saline and alkali, peaty and marshy\\nsoils, and in acid soils. But the soil having good retention capacity with good amount of clay and\\norganic matter is ideal for rice cultivation. Clay and clay loam soils are most suited. It tolerates a wide\\nrange of soil reaction from 4.5–8.0. It grows well in soils having pH range of 5.5–6.5. It can be grown\\non alkali soil after treating them with gypsum or pyrites.\\nF. Rice Ecosystems\\nBased on land and water management practices, rice lands are classified as low land (wet land) and\\nupland (dry land). In India, the principal systems of rice growing are\\n1. Dry system (upland)\\n2. Semi-dry system\\n3. Wet system (lowland)\\n1. Dry System or Upland Rice:  In India, it is normally grown in  eastern part of India i.e., Assam,\\nWest Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and central part of India (Madhya Pradesh, part of Andhra\\nPradesh and Maharashtra). This system is called Aus in West Bengal, aus/ahu in Assam, beali in Orissa,\\nbhadi or Kuari in Uttar Pradesh. In Tamil Nadu, it is mainly grown in Chengleput, Virudhunagar,\\nSivaganga, Nagapatinam, Thiruvallur, Kanchipuram, Pudukkottai and Kanyakumari districts. It is grown\\nin areas where the rainfall is more than 850 mm and it is well distributed. In North India, it is mainly\\ngrown in SWM seasons and in Tamil Nadu, it is grown during NEM seasons/bimodal rainfall areas of\\nKanyakumari districts.\\n(a) Field preparation: The field is ploughed and harrowed to fine tilth taking advantage of summer\\nrains and early monsoon showers. Application of gypsum at 1.0 t/ha is recommended whenever soil\\ncrusting and soil hardening problem exists. During the last ploughing, organic manures like FYM or\\ncompost at 12.5 t/ha is applied and incorporated.\\n(b) Season:\\nMay-June in SWM area\\nAugust-September in NEM dominant area.\\n(c) Varieties: V arieties having 90-110 days are recommended.\\n\\x7f TKM 9: red rice, 100–105 days, short, bold grain, 5 t/ha.\\n\\x7f TPS 1: red rice, 110–115 days, short bold grain, 4.8 t/ha\\n\\x7f TPS 2: 125 days, non-lodging, 5 t/ha, suitable for kumbapu season\\n\\x7f TPS 3: 135 days, non-lodging, 5.3 t/ha, suitable for kumbapu season.\\n\\x7f MDU 5: 95–110 days, 5 t/ha, multiple resistant to pest and diseases.\\n\\x7f PKM 1: 110–115 days, dull white rice, pigmented, coarse grain and high protein, 3.2 t/ha.'),\n",

Preparation of nursery for sowing\\nAbout 20 cents (800 m2) for planting one ha is required. Raise the nursery near the water source. Apply\\n1 t of FYM or compost to 20 cents of nursery and spread the manure uniformly. Before ploughing,\\nallow water to a depth of 2.5 cm. Before last puddling, apply 40 kg of DAP @ 2 kg/cent. Basal\\napplication of DAP is recommended when the seedlings are to be pulled out in 20–25 DAS. If the\\nseedlings are to be pulled out after 25 days, application of DAP is to be done 10 days prior to pulling\\nout. In clayey soils, where root snapping is a problem, DAP has to be applied at 1 kg/cent 10 DAS.\\nMark out plots, 2.5 m broad with channels, 30 cm wide in between. Collect the mud from the\\nchannel and spread on the seedbed and level the surface of seedbed so that water drains into the\\nchannel.\\nHaving a thin film of water in the nursery, sow the sprouted seeds uniformly on the  seedbed.\\nE. Water management\\nFor water management in nursery, first drain the water 18–24 hrs after sowing and allow enough water\\nto saturate the soil from 3–5th day. From 5th day onwards, increase the quantity of water to a depth of\\n1.5 cm depending on the height of seedling s. Afterwards, maintain 2.5 cm depth of water.\\nF. Weed management\\nApply any one of the pre-emergence herbicide like Butachlor or Thiobencarb at 2.0 lit/ha or Pendimethalin\\nat 2.5 lit/ha or Anilophos at 1.25 lit/ha on 8 DAS to control weeds in the nursery. Keep thin film of water\\nat the time of herbicide application and should not drain the water after application.\\nG. Top dressing with fertilizers\\nIf the seedlings show the symptoms of ‘N’ deficiency and if the growth is not satisfactory, apply urea\\nat 500 g/cent of nursery, 7–10 days prior to pulling .

Main field preparation for transplanted rice\\nWet rice requires a well puddled soil. Ploughing under submerged soil condition is called puddling. The\\nland is ploughed repeatedly 3 or 4 times with an  interval of about 4 days between each puddling by\\ncountry plough or mould board plough or tractor drawn ca ge wheel or by using power tiller with a\\nstanding water of 3–5 cm. Optimum depth of puddling is 10 cm for clay and clay loam soils.\\nJ. Application of organic manures\\nApply 12.5 t of FYM or compost/ha and spread the manure uniformly on the dry soil before applying\\nthe water. If FYM or compost is not available, apply green manure/green leaf manure at 6.25 t/ha.\\nCompute the green matter using the formula.\\nYield/m2 in kg × 10,000.\\nThe yield of green manure is 10–15 t/ha for daincha, 8–15 t/ha for sunnhemp and 6–7.5 t/ha for\\nKolingi.'),\n",

In clay soil, ‘N’ should be applied in three splits viz., 50% basal + 25%\\nat max. tillering + 25% at panicle initiation stage. Application 25 kg of ZnSO4 at the time of sowing is\\nrecommended and it should not be incorporated.\\n(a) Nitrogen: N will be lost by different ways; 1. D enitrification loss, 2. Fixation by microbes,\\n3. Leaching loss, 4. V olatilization loss, 5. Run-off, 6. Ammonium fixation, and 7. Crop uptake. Among\\nthe losses, denitrification and leaching losses are more in paddy soil under submerged due to low redox\\npotential. To increase N use efficiency, the following methods may be followed:\\n\\x7f Choice of fertilizer: The choice of fertilizers is Ammonium Sulphate > Ammonium chloride >\\nAmmonium sulphate nitrate > Urea > CAN. In India, 85% of production is urea due to less unit\\ncost and most of the farmers are using urea.\\n\\x7f Split application of ‘N’: Application of N in 3–4 splits depending on soil type wil increase\\nNUE. If green manure is applied, skip basal application of N. Under this situation, ‘N’ as top\\ndressing in 3 splits at 10 days interval between 15 and 45 days after transplanting is recom-\\nmended for short and medium duration varieties.\\n\\x7f Slow release fertilizer: Use of chemically manufactured slow release N fertilizers to increase\\nthe NUE. e.g., IBDU-Isobutylidene di urea and UF-Urea formaldehyde. Slow release by Coated\\nurea with physical/mechanical means. E.g., ( a) sulphur coated urea, ( b) neem coated urea,\\n(c) gypsum coated urea, ( d) mud ball urea etc.\\n\\x7f Placement of urea super granules: Bigger size urea super granules are placed directly into the\\nreduced zone (below 10 cm depth) to avoid loss of N.\\n\\x7f Use of nitrification inhibitors: To control the conversion of NH4 to NO3 inhibiting the activity\\nof nitrosomonas and nitrobacter. E.g., AM, N-Serve etc., but these are not available in India.\\n(b) Phosphorus: It is essential for root growth, for early ripening, production of efficient and early\\ntillers. Upland rice responds to more ‘P’ than low land rice, since submergence increases the availability\\nof different forms of fixed ‘P’ in the soil. Nearly 80–90% of P is absorbed up to flowering:\\n\\x7f Sources - Single super phosphate (SSP) is the best source for normal and saline soils. Rock\\nphosphate is the best source for acid soil.\\n\\x7f Time and method of application:  Since ‘P’ is an immobile element and crop needs ‘P’ espe-\\ncially in the early stage, basal application at the time of puddling is superior than top dressing.\\n\\x7f Rate of application: 50 kg/ha for medium and long duration varieties and 38 kg/ha for short\\nduration varieties is recommended. ‘P’ use efficiency can be increased with green manuring with\\naddition of rock phosphate. When DAP is applied in the nursery, 1/3rd of recommended dose of\\n‘P’ can be applied to main field\\n(c) Potassium: Compared to N and P, r ice absorbs more K. Potassium absorption is up to dough\\nstage. Nearly 50-60% of K is absorbed from seedling to jointing stage (20–25 days). So, entire ‘K’ is\\napplied as basal in clay soil. In light soils, K is applied in two splits viz. 50% basal and 50% at\\nmaximum tillering or panicle initiation stage. In some cases, K is applied with N in splits.'),\n",

Hence KCl is recommended.\\n(d) Zinc: It is more important for rice next to N, P and K. The deficiency occurs in sodic soils,\\nalkaline soils, sandy soils and during continuous submergence. High amount of Ca and Mg reduces Zn\\nuptake. Zn deficiency causes the physiological disorders like (1) Khaira disease and (2) Akagare\\n–Type II. Akiochi disease is due toxicity of H 2S when high organic matter is present along with Fe\\ntoxicity. Zn deficiency can be corrected by dipping rice roots in 1% ZnO (Zinc oxide) or by basal\\napplication of ZnSO4 at 25 kg/ha (only surface application and no incorporation).

Aerobic rice\\nWater in irrigated rice production has been taken for granted for centuries,  but the “looming water\\ncrisis” may change the way of rice production in the future. Water saving irrigation technologies that\\nwere investigated in the early 1970s, such as saturated soil culture and alternate wetting and drying, are\\nreceiving renewed attention from researchers. These technologies reduce water input, though mostly at\\nthe expense of some yield loss. Farmers in Asia who confront scarcity or high costs of water have\\nalready started to adopt these technologies.\\nAerobic rice is a new concept to further decrease water requirements in rice production. It is\\ncommercially grown in Brazil and is being pioneered by farmers in northern China. In the heart of the\\nrice-wheat belt in India (Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh), innovative farmers have begun to grow\\nrice aerobically under furrow irrigation in raised bed systems. Over the centuries, lowland rice has\\nproven to be a remarkably anaerobic character. T he shift from anaerobic to aerobic systems will have\\nmajor consequences for weed, disease and pest management, nutrient and soil organic mater dynamics,\\nand green house gas emission and sequestration. Weed control is an especially crucial issue in most\\nwater-saving irrigation technologies.\\nConcept: A fundamental approach to reduce water inputs in rice is to grow the crop like an\\nirrigated upland crop such as wheat or maize. Instead of trying to reduce water input in lowland fields,\\nthe concept of having the field flooded or saturated is abandoned altogether. Upland crops are grown\\nin non-puddled aerobic soil without standing water. Irrigation is applied to bring the soil water content\\nin the root zone up to field capacity after it has reached a certain lower threshold (e.g., halfway between\\nfield capacity and wilting point). Since it is not possible to apply irrigation water to the root zone only,\\nsome of it is lost by deep percolation and is unavailable for uptake by the crop. Typical field application\\nefficiencies vary from 60-70% using surface irrigation ( e.g., flash or furrow irrigation) to more than\\n90% using sprinkler or drip irrigation. Evaporation can also be reduced with this technique, since there\\nis no continuous standing water layer.\\nAreas to be grown under aerobic rice\\nThe aerobic rice can be raised in the areas:\\n\\x7f Where rainfall is insufficient to sustain lowland rice production (estimated to require\\n1,200–1,500 mm) but thought to be sufficient for aerobic rice (estimated to require some 800\\nmm). Here, maize is the dominant crop and rice is an attractive alternative through the benefits\\nof crop diversification.\\n\\x7f In pump-irrigated areas where water has becomes so expensive that lowland rice production was\\nabandoned.\\n\\x7f Where water is scarce during the first part of the growing season (necessitating irrigation), but\\nfloods occur in the second part, upland crops such as maize and soybean cannot withstand\\nflooding, but aerobic rice can.\\nY. System of rice intensification (SRI)\\nSRI involves the use of certain management practices, which together provide better growing condi-\\ntions for rice plants, particularly in the root zone, than those plants grown under traditional practices.\\nSRI was developed in Madagascar in the early 1980s by Father Henri de Lauhanie, a Jesuit priest.

It has since been\\ntested in China, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh with positive results. Most rice\\nfarmers plant fairly mature seedlings (20-30  days old), in clumps, fair ly close together with standing\\nwater maintained in the field for as much of the season as possible. These practices seem to reduce the\\nrisk of crop failure. It seems lo gical that more mature plants should survive better, that planting in\\nclumps will ensure, that some seedlings should result in more yield; and that planting in standing water\\nmeans the plants will never lack water and weeds will have little opportunity to grow. There are six\\npractices in SRI.\\n1. Y oung seedlings: Seedlings are transplanted early. Rice seedlings are transplanted when only\\nthe first two leaves have emerged from the initial tiller or stalk, usually when they are between\\n8 and 15 days old. Seedlings should be grown in a nursery in which the soil is kept moist but not\\nflooded. The seed sac should be kept attached to the infant root, because it is an important\\nenergy source for the young seedlings. The young seedlings should be planted so carefully that\\nthe root tip is not left pointing upward.\\n2. Single seedling: Seedlings are planted singly rather than clumps of two or three or more. This\\nmeans that individual plants have room to spread and to send down roots. They do not compete\\nas much with other rice plants for space, light and nutrients in the soil.\\n3. Wider spacing: Seedlings are planted in a square pattern with plenty of space between them in\\nall directions. Usually, they are spaced at least 22.5 cm × 22.5 cm. It helps for vigorous root\\ngrowth and more tillering. The square pattern facilitates in situ  incorporation of weeds by\\nConoweeder.\\n4. Lesser seed rate: SRI method requires much lower seed rate (5–8 kg/ha) than traditional meth-\\nods (75–100 kg/ha).\\nFig. 15.14 SRI–Using conoweeder\\n5. Moist but unflooded soil conditions: Rice has traditionally been grown in water under sub-\\nmerged condition. In SRI method, soil is kept moist but not flooded during the vegetative period,\\nensuring that more oxygen is availab le in the soil for the roots, occasionally the soil should be\\nallowed to dry to a point of cracking e xcept in saline soils. This will allow oxygen to enter the\\nsoil and also induce the roots to grow and search for water. In SRI method, unflooded condition'),\n",

Conoweeding: Weeding can be done by conoweeder. The cost of conoweeder will be around\\nRs. 800–1500/- depending upon the type and materials used. First weeding should be done on\\n14 DA T and this should be continued up to 40 days at 7–10 days interval. At least two or three\\nweeding is r ecommended. This practice seems to improve the soil structure and increases the\\nsoil aeration. Thus, the incorporation of weed biomass into the soil results in enrichment of CO2\\nnear to root zone, increases the biolog ical activities, increases soil microbes population and\\nactivities, results in better nutrient availability in soil and uptake by plants. If conoweeder is not\\navailable, rotary weeder can be used.\\n2. WHEAT (Triticum aestivum or T. Vulgare)\\nWheat is world’s most widely cultivated food crop. It is a rabi (winter) season crop. In India it is the\\nsecond important staple cereal food. It is mostly eaten in the form of chapaties. Wheat is also used for\\nmanufacturing bread, flakes, cakes, biscuits etc. Wheat straw is a good source of feed for cattle. Wheat\\ncontains more protein (8–15%) than in other cereals. Wheat proteins are of special significance. The\\nprotein contained in wheat includes albumins, globulins, glutinous and gliadines. Albumins dissolve in\\nwater. The other protein forms are insoluble in water and are called gluten. The gluten content in wheat\\nis the highest (16–50%). Because of gluten, wheat flour is used for baking bread.\\nA. Origin\\nDe candolle—Euphrates and Tigris and spread from there to China, Egypt and other parts of the world.\\nVavilov—Ab yssinia and the whole group of soft wheat originated in the region of Pakistan, Southwest-\\nern Afghanistan and the southern parts of mountainous Bokhara.\\nB.

Systems of Wheat culture\\n1. Irrigated wheat 2. Rainfed wheat\\nI. Irrigated wheat\\nLand preparation: In general, wheat requires a well-pulverized, but compact seedbed for good and\\nuniform germination. In irrigated areas, wheat is sown after kharif crops, hence the field is ploughed\\nwith disc or mould board plough followed by 2–3 harrowing and 2–3 planking should be given. One\\npre sowing irrigation 7–10 days before seeding is necessary to ensur e good germination.\\nSeed rate- Normal sowing : 100 kg/ha\\nBold seed/later sown condition : 125 kg/ha\\nSeed treatment: Treat the seeds with any one of the fungicides like captan or thiram at 2 g/kg of seeds\\n24 hours before sowing.\\nSpacing: For normal sown crop : 20–22.5 cm between the rows\\nFor delayed sowing : 15–18 cm.\\nDepth of sowing: Since the coleoptiles length is 5 cm, depth of sowing should not more than 5 cm and\\nthe optimum depth of sowing is 2.5–5.0 cm.\\nMethod of sowing\\n(a) Broadcast sowing: Seeds are broadcasted and then worked in by harrowing to cover the seeds.\\nIn this method, germination is very poor and plant stand is often irregular, since the seeds are not\\nplaced in the moist zone.\\n(b) Sowing behind the country plough: A majority of farmers use this method. The seed is dropped\\nin furrows by hand and it is called as ‘Kera method’ and when it is dropped through a ‘pora’, a\\nspecial set of attachment with local plough, it is called “Pora method”. In this method, seeds are\\ndropped at 5–6 cm depth.\\n(c) Drilling: Seeds are sown by seed drill or fertiseed drill.

Green cobs are roasted and\\neaten by the people. Popcorn is used for popped form; green cob for table purpose. Corn has low fibre\\ncontent, more carbohydrate and most palatable. It is widely used in preparation of cattle feed and\\npoultry feed. It can be used as green fodder and has no HCN content. It can be preserved as silage. Food\\nproducts like corn meal, corn flakes etc., can be prepared. It is used in making industrial products like\\nalcohol, corn starch (dextrose), glucose, corn oil, corn syrup etc., and used in canning industry, production\\nof polymer, making paper, paper boards, bread etc., Maize grain contains proteins (10%), carbohydrates\\n(70%), oil (4%), albuminoides (10.4%), crude fibre (2.3%) and ash (1.4%).

Maize is low in calcium, but fairly high\\nin ‘P. Maize protein ‘Zein’ is deficient in two essential amino acids viz., Lysine and ‘Tryptophane’.\\nA. Classification\\nClassification is largely based on the character of the kernels. It is classified into  seven groups\\n(Kipps, 1959).\\n1. Flint corn ( Zea mays indurate ): Starchy endosperm enclosed with hard hammy endosperm.\\nKernel size is large with flat bottom and round at the top.High proportion of starch. Colour may\\nbe white or yellow. This is the type mostly grown in India.\\n2. Dent corn ( Z. mays indentata): Because of formation of dent on the top of kernel having white\\nor yellow, it is called as dent corn. Maize kernels have both soft and hard starches. The hard\\nstarch extends on the sides and the soft starch is in the centre and extends to the top of the kernel.\\nDepression or dent in the crown on the seed is the result of drying and shrinkage of soft starch.\\nThis type is widely grown in USA.\\n3. Pop corn ( Z. mays averta): Kernel size is small. Har d and corneous endosperm is present.\\n4. Sweet corn ( Z.mays saccharata ): The sugar and starch make the major component of the\\nendosperm that results in sweet taste of kernels. It is mainly grown in Northern half of USA. The\\ncobs are picked up green for canning and table purpose.\\n5. Flour corn ( Z. mays amylaceae ): It resembles to the flint corn in a ppearance and ear\\ncharacteristics. The grains are composed of soft starch and have little or no dent (called as “soft\\ncorn”). It is widely grown in USA and South Africa.\\n6. Pod corn ( Z. mays tunicata): Each kernel is enclosed in a pod or husk in an ear, which enclosed\\nin husks, like other types of corn.\\n7. Waxy corn  (Z. mays cerabina)- The kernel looks to have waxy appearance and gummy starch\\nin them, because of amylopectin. Starch is similar to that of tapioca starch for making adhesive.\\nB. Origin\\nMexico and Central America.\\nC. Area and Production\\nIt is cultivated in an area of 130 m.ha with a production of 580 m.t. It is grown in USA, China, Brazil,\\nMexico and India. USA ranks first in area, production and productivity (6865 kg/ha). India occupies 5th\\nplace in area and 11th place in production. In India, it is cultivated in area of 6.25 m.ha with a produc-\\ntion of 10.61 m.t. Average productivity is 1698 kg/ha. In India, it is cultivated in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan,\\nMadhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Bihar. The production level is in the order of Uttar Pradesh > Bihar >\\nKarnataka. Karnataka recorded the highest average yield of 3379 kg/ha.\\nIn Tamil Nadu, it is cultivated in an area of 81,800 ha with a production of 1,32,900 t and produc-\\ntivity of 1625 kg/ha. It is mainly cultivated in Coimbatore, Erode, Salem, Madurai, Trichy, Thanjavur\\nand Pudukottai districts. It is cultivated in southern districts, Dindugul and Perambalur districts under\\nrainfed condition.\\nD. Climate\\nIt is essentially a tropical crop. It is a C4 short day plant. Though it is a tropical crop, it has got high\\nadaptability to wider climate (55°N–45°S). It can be grown up to 2500 m above MSL. This crop is not\\nsuitable when night temper ature drops below 15.6°C. Maize requires moist and warm weather from\\ngermination to flowering. Most suitable temperature for ger mination is 21°C and for growth is 32°C.'),\n",

It is the major source of food for large number of peoples in cooler semiarid\\nparts of the world. It is the staple food in Tibet, Nepal and Bhutan. In European countries, it is used only\\nas break fast food. Barley contains protein (11.5%), carbohydrates (74%), fat (1.3%), crude fibre\\n(3.9%) and ash (1.5%). Flour is used for making ‘Chapatti’ along with wheat flour or gram flour and\\nused as “Missi rotti”. It is used for preparation of malt, beer, whisky and industrial alcohol, vinegar and\\nit is also used in malt and brewing industries and biscuit making. Grain is broken and roughly ground\\ninto pearl barley to be used in soup. Excess grain is used as cattle feed and horse feed.\\nOrigin: Abyssinia as the centre of origin f or hulled, awned type and South-East Asia particularly,\\nChina, Tibet and Nepal as centre of origin for hullless six rowed varieties.\\nClassification: Cultivated barley varieties are classified based on number of rows of grain and their\\narrangement.

The crop possesses high degree of tolerance to drought and sodic condition.\\nSoil: Sandy to moderately heavy loam soil of Indo-gangetic plains having neutral to saline in\\nreaction and medium fertility are most suited for barley. Being a salt tolerant crop, it is the best\\nsubstitute for sodic soils and also for saline coastal soils in West Bengal and black soils of Karnataka.\\nA higher spot with efficient drainage would be best location for barley. The soil should not be very\\nfertile which causes lodging and reduce the yield. Acidic soils are not suitable.\\nSeason: The season is given below:\\nRainfed crop : Before end of October or 1st week of November\\nIrrigated : 1st or 2nd week of November\\nLate sown : Up to December\\nHilly zones (2000 m) : 1st week of November\\nSeed rate: The seed rate for irrigated crop is 75–100 kg/ha and it is 80–100 kg/ha for rainfed crop\\nand 100 kg/ha for crops raised in saline soil.\\nSpacing: The spacing for irrigated crop is 23 cm row spacing and for rainfed crop, row spacing of\\n23–25 cm is followed.

OATS (Avena sativa)\\nIt is one of the most important rabi/winter cereal fodder crops of India. It is used as green fodder, straw,\\nhay or silage. Oat grains make a good balanced concentrate in the rations for poultry, cattle, sheep and\\nhorse. Green fodder contains about 10–12% protein and 30–35% dry matter. It is fed to animals mixed\\nwith berseem or lucerne green fodder. Its fodder and grains are highly nutritious and preferred by milch\\ncattle and draft animals. V ery small portion of oat grain is processed into food in the form of “rolled oats\\nand oat meal” for human consumption.\\nOrigin: Perhaps originated in Asia Minor.\\nArea: The leading oat producing countries are former USSR, USA, Canada, Poland, China, France\\nand Australia. It is cultivated in an area of 26.8 m.ha. with a production of 40.3 m.t. In India , it is\\ncultivated on large scale in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and a limited area in certain part of Himachal\\nPradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Bihar and West Bengal. In Tamil Nadu, it is grown in\\nNilgris.\\nClassification: According to their chromosome number, the oats are grouped into three groups.\\nGroup I: A. brevis: Short oats are grown in Southern Eur ope for green fodder and hay.\\nGroup II: A. abyssinica: “Abyssinian oat” is grown in several parts of North Africa for fodder.\\nGroup III: A. sativa: “Common Oat”. It occupies 80% of total acreage under oat.\\nA. byzantina: “Red oat” is grown around Mediterranean region, Europe and North Asia and warmer\\nsub tropical area for both grains and fodder . It is also cultivated in India, next to A. sativa. It is a heat\\ntolerant crop.\\nA. chirensis: Chinese naked oat extensively is grown in hilly parts of China for grain.\\nA. strigosa: Called “sand oat”.\\nDual purpose (Grain and fodder): Grown in Mediterr anean region. Of this, 80% of area is under\\nA. sativa and the remaining area is under by A. byzantina.\\nClimate: It requires cool temperature during germination, tillering, booting and heading stages.\\nHigh temperature at blooming increases empty spikelets and reduces the seed yield. Oat requires about\\n15–25º C for its optimum growth. Oat requires more moisture to produce a given unit of dry matter than\\nany other cereal except rice. Rainfall should not exceed 760 mm and should be well distributed.\\nSoil: It can be grown on all types of soils except the alkaline water logged soils. Oats generally\\nmake their best growth on loamy soils, but produce satisfactory yield on heavy or light soil .\\nVarieties:\\nKent: Introduced from Australia, mid late variety, resistant to blight, rust and lodging, dual purpose,\\nfodder yield of 60–65 t/ha, grain yield of 3–3.5 t/ha.\\nAlgerian: For irrigated areas, slow growing, 145–150 days duration, green fodder yield of 40–45 t/ha.\\nBunker 10: Mid season variety, suitable for moisture shortage condition, resistant to loose smut,\\ngreen fodder yield of 40 t/ha.'),\n",

TRITICALE\\nRye, a member of the Poaceae family, is popular ly grown as fodder in foreign countries and the same\\nis found on the North Indian hills. It has characteristic feature of growing very profuse with exceptionally\\nmore number of tillers per plant under poor fertility status of soil having marginal or no irrigation\\nfacilities. Breeders took rye for crossing with wheat and the resultant offspring was named as man made\\ncereal or rye wheat scientifically known as triticale. This was done with a view to reduce the required\\ninput in wheat production and to increase the unit area. Besides these, triticale has about 20% protein\\nand a very high biological value, but the greatest drawback is that the grain colour is dark-red, seeds are\\nvery wrinkled with low viability and the plants have a very high degree of sterility. The grains are also\\nsusceptible to store grain pests. In the present day breeding, these points are being taken into active\\nconsideration and probably in near future the farmers would be having a good number of triticale\\nvarieties for the cultivation.\\n15.3 MILLETS\\n1. JOWAR OR SORGHUM (Sorghum bicolor)\\nIt belongs to family Poaceae and genus sorghum. Sorghum is one of the major food crops of the world,\\nparticularly Africa and Asia. In India, it ranks third in major food crop, especially central and peninsular\\nIndia. It is used in various forms, similar to rice as cooked food, m alted, flour for dosai and making\\nchapatti or rotti, popped, semolina etc. It is a very  good dry and green fodder and a good concentrate\\nfeed for cattle and poultry. Raw material is used for starch Industries. It is used in production of alcohol\\nsimilar to corn and used for preparation of sorghum syrup (20–25% sugar) from sweet sorghum vari-\\neties. It is also used for production of Jaggery. It contains high amount of aconitic acid, which prevents\\nthe crystallization of sugar. It contains 72.6% carbohydrate, 10–12% protein, 3% fat, 1.6% mineral and'),\n",

It has the capacity to withstand drought or excess moisture (92% of sorghum is\\ngrown under rainfed). It comes up well even in marginal soil under moisture stress. It does well in low\\nrainfall areas. It makes comparatively quick growth than maize. It is dormant during stress condition\\nand it resumes its growth, when optimum condition occurs.\\nUndesirable qualities: It contains high amount of Niacin, which interface with the synthesis of\\nTryptophane, which is the precursor for synthesis of IAA. “ Pellagara” is nutritional disorder due to\\npresence of high amount of Leucine: iso-leucine ratio (3.4). W hen it is reduced, yield is also reduced.\\nThis disease is common in Africa. It contains considerable amount of oxalic acid, which interface with\\nabsorption of Ca and metabolism of Ca. Phytin ‘P’ is not utilized due to high oxalic acid. Oxalic acid\\nalso affects the Fe uptake. Low digestibility and low palatability is due to presence of phenolic compounds\\nand glycosides, tannin and lignin. Sorghum contains “cynogenic glucoside” called ‘Dhurin’. This\\nglucoside is converted into HCN in the stomach of ruminants. It causes bloating and reduce the transfer\\nof O2 to the blood steam and causes death of the animal. It is called “ sorghum poisoning”/(sorghum\\neffect). HCN content is more than 100 ppm in the early stage . Critical level is 50 ppm. It (50 ppm)\\nnormally occurs during 60-65 DAS or at heading stage. If it is har vested earlier, it should be dried and\\nfed to cattle. “ Sorghum injury”—Sorghum stubb les/roots have high C:N ratio (50:1), i.e., it contains\\nlow amount of ‘N’. Hence, microbes take the soil ‘N’ for decomposition than from the decomposed\\nstubble, which causes temporary immobilization of soil ‘N’. Hence, succeeding crop after sorghum is\\naffected due to N deficiency in the early stage called sorghum injury. Succeeding crops need higher N.\\nOrigin: Warth (1937): Africa and Decandolle (1984): Abyssinia.\\nClassification: Harlen and De-Wet (1971), gave a modified and simple classification based on\\nspikelet type.\\n(a) Basic races: 1.

Long day condition delays flowering and maturity. It is a warm\\nweather plant and is grown even in 1500 m from MSL. It can tolerate high temperature throughout their\\nlife cycle, better than any other cereal. It is highly resistant to desiccation. It can tolerate water logging.\\nLow temperature at flowering affects the seed set. Rainfall at maturity affects the quality of grain. Low\\ntemperature with cloudy weather at flowering induces sugary disease.\\nSoil: It is grown under variety of soil. Soil with clay loam or loamy texture having good water\\nretention is best suited. It does not thrive in sandy soils, but does better in heavier soils. It does well in\\npH range of 6.0–8.5 as it tolerates considerable salinity and alkalinity. The black cotton soils of Central\\nIndia are very good for its cultivation.

The right stage for harvest is, w hen the grain becomes hard having less than 25%\\nmoisture. Do not wait for stubble and leaves to dry, because hybrid sorghum appears green even after\\nthe crop is matured. Harvest may be done at physiological maturity. Harvesting is done by cutting the\\nentire plant or removing the ear heads first and cutting down the plants later and is allowed to dry for\\n2–5 days. Threshing is done with the help of thresher or beating the ear heads. The threshed grain is\\ndried in the sun for a week to bring the moisture content to 10–12% for safe storage.\\nYield: The grain yield varies from 2–3 t/ha under rainfed conditions and the dry stover yield varies\\nfrom 8–10 t/ha.\\nII. Irrigated Sorghum\\nIt is raised by either direct seeding or transplanting.  Irrigated transplanted crop has advantages like\\nmain field duration is reduced by 10 days; shoot fly attacks will be economically controlled in the\\nnursery; seedlings which show chlor otic and downy mildew symptoms can be eliminated; optimum\\npopulation can be maintained as only healthy seedlings are used and seed rate is reduced by 2.5 kg/ha.\\nVarieties: CO 25 (115–120 days, grain yield of 6.0 t/ha, straw yield of 17.5 t/ha), CO 26 (105–110\\ndays, grain yield of 6.0 t/ha, straw yield of 19.0 t/ha), BSR 1 (105–110 days, grain yield of 6–6.5 t/ha,\\nstraw yield of 9.6 t/ha).\\nHybrids: CSH 5 (100 days, grain yield of 4.5 t/ha, straw yield of 12.5 t/ha), COH 4 (105–110 days,\\ngrain yield of 6.5 t/ha, straw yield of 20.0 t/ha), COH 5 (100 days, grain yield of 6.8 t/ha, straw yield\\nof 19.0 t/ha).\\nSeason: In Tamil Nadu, it is cultivated in two seasons viz., January-February (Thaipattam) and\\nApril–May (Chithiraipattam).\\nSeed rate: The seed rate for direct sowing is 10 kg/ha and 7.5 kg/ha for transplanting.\\nNursery\\n(i) Preparation: For planting one ha, about 7.5 cent (300 m 2) nursery area is required, near the\\nwater source.

For\\nraising intercrop and paired row system, a spacing of 60/30 × 15 cm may be adopted. Raising one row\\nof pulses in between 60 cm row spacing is common.\\nThinning and gap filling: In the direct sown crop, thinning one seeding per hill and gap filling the\\nthinned out seedlings is done on 10–15 DAS, maintaining a spacing of 15 cm between plants.\\nWeed management: Sorghum is slow growing in the early stage and is adversely affected by weed\\ncompetition. Keeping the fields free of weeds up to 45 days is good. Pre-emergence herbicide Atrazine 50\\nWP at 500 g/ha (atrazine 0.25 kg/ha) on 3 DAS using high volume sprayer followed by one hand weeding\\non 30–35 DAS is recommended. If pulse crop is raised as intercrop, do not use atrazine. If herbicide is\\nnot used, for transplanted crop, two hoeing and weeding on 10 and 30–35 DAS should be done. In the\\ncase of direct seeded crop, two hand weeding on 15–20 DAS and 35–40 DAS should be done.\\nWater management: Total water requirement is 450–500 mm. Irrigation at 50% depletion of\\navailable soil moisture or 0.6 IW/CPE ratio is sufficient. There are four critical stages viz., (1) seedling,\\n(2) vegetative, (3) flowering, (4) dough stages. Stress at one week before and one week after flowering\\nis very critical. Under moisture stress condition, 5 ir rigations are sufficient. For normal condition, 8\\nirrigations are to be given i.e. on 1st day, 4th day, 15th, 28th,  40th, 53th, 64th, 76th and 88th days.\\nIrrigation should be stopped after 88–90 DAS. As contingent plan, spraying 3% Kaolin (30 g in one litre\\nof water) during periods of stress will mitigate the ill effects.\\nHarvesting and processing: When the crop matures, leaves turn yellow and the grains are hard\\nand firm and moisture content will be less than 25%. At this stage, the earheads are cut separately and\\ndried for 2–3 days and threshing using mechanical thresher is done and the grain is dried to 12%\\nmoisture for safe storage. The straw is cut after a week and allowed it to dry and then stacked for fodder.'),\n",

In the case\\nof aged seedlings beyond 21 days, the number of seedlings is increased to 3/hill and N by 25% is\\nincreased to reduce the loss.\\nWater management: Generally, in heavy and light soils, totally 9 irrigations are required. Depend-\\ning upon the duration of the crop (80, 100 and 120 days) and stage of the crop, one or two or three\\nirrigations may be skipped or given. The critical sta ges are tillering and preflowering stages.\\nWeed management: Application of Butachlor 2.5 l/ha or Fluchloralin 2 l/ha or pendimethalin\\n2.5 l/ha as pre-emergence with 900 l of water is done and if sufficient moisture is not available,\\nirrigation is done immediately.

About 4–5 rows of ragi with a row of field bean is very common in\\nKarnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Ragi is sequenced with groundnut, horse gram, cotton, tobacco or sesame.\\nPest and disease management: To control mosaic virus, spraying Monocrotophos 36 WSC 0.05%\\nis recommended. To control blast, spraying of carbendazim 250 g/ha is recommended. If needed, 2nd\\nand 3rd spray may be given at 15 days interval after 1st spray. To control root aphids, dimethioate at\\n3 ml is mixed with 1 of water and drenching is done.\\nHarvesting: It does not mature uniformly and hence harv est is done in two stages. 1st harvest is\\ndone when ear head of main shoot and 50% of ear heads turn brown.

It is used as fodder in Africa and Asia. Oxalic acid content is very high.\\nSo it is not relished by cattle. It is rich in protein (12.6%) and fat (5%), fibre (1.2%) and 60–70% of\\nCarbohydrate. It is normally rich in Ca, Vitamin Riboflavin and Carotenoides. In Central America, it is\\nmainly cultivated for forage purpose. It is also grown as pasture grass. Of the 150 sps of Pennesitum,\\nP . glaucum is the cultivated species for grain and P . purpurea is the forage species.\\nOrigin-Africa\\nArea, Production and Distribution: It is largely grown in India. The important pearl millet producing\\ncountries are India , Africa, Pakistan, China, Sudan and Egypt. In India,  it is cultivated in an area of\\n10 m.ha with a production of 7.9 m.t and productivity of 791 kg/ha. Area under cultivation is high in\\nRajasthan, followed by Maharashtra, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. The production is more in Rajasthan,\\nfollowed by Maharastra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. In Tamil Nadu, it is cultivated in an\\narea of 2.3 l.ha with production of 2.5 l.ton and productivity of 1226 kg/ha. In Tamil Nadu, it is grown\\nin all the districts, except Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur and Nilgris.\\nStages: There are four crop stages namely seedling stage (1–18 days), Tillering stage (19–35 days),\\nFlowering phase (36–55 days) and Maturity phase (56–85 days)\\nClimate: It is a rapid gr owing, warm weat her crop and it has resistance for drought. The best\\ntemperature is between 20 and 28°C. It can withstand even desiccation. It is highly suitable for the areas\\nhaving rainfall ranges from 400–750 mm. Even 150 mm of rainfall is sufficient. Rainfall during veg-\\netative phase is highly favourable, while rain fall at flowering is not conducive, as it washes off the\\npollen and there is a poor seed setting. The crop grows better in light showers followed by bright\\nsunshine. Usually bajra is grown, where it is not possible to grow sorghum because of high temperature\\nand low rainfall. It is grown as kharif crop in Northern India, while in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and\\nPunjab, it is grown under irrigated condition during summer.\\nSoil: It is grown in a wide variety of soils, but being sensitive to water logging. It grows well in well\\ndrained sandy loams. It is sensitive to acidic soil. It is grown successfully in black cotton soil, alluvial\\nsoils and red soils of India.\\nTime of sowing: In India, it is grown in three  seasons viz., kharif (rainfed-June–October), winter\\n(rainfed–November-February) and summer (rain fed–March-June). During summer, it is grown in Tamil\\nNadu, Karnataka, Punjab and Gujar at as an irrigated crop.\\nHybrids: Under All India Co-ordinated Research project, many hybrids have been developed.\\nUsing Cytoplasmic male sterile line (CMS line), five hybrids have been developed. Among them,\\nHB-3 is the best. But all hybrids are susceptible to downy mildew. To overcome the downy mildew,\\nCMS line MS.5071 was used and five New Hybrid bajra were developed. Among them, NHB.5 is the\\nbest for disease resistance and wide adaptability besides giving higher yield. In Tamil Nadu, using CMS\\nline MS 5141 A, two hybrids X 6 and X 7 were evolved and are recommended for cultivation.\\nX6: 90–100 days, irrigated crop yields 3236 kg/ha and rainfed crop yields 2394 kg/ha.

It\\nremoves about 90 kg N, 20–25 kg, P2 O5 and 160 kg K2O. For Zn deficient soil, application of ZnSO 4\\nat 25 kg/ha is done. Iron deficiency occurs in saline and calcareous soil. Based on the level of defi-\\nciency, 12.5–25 kg of FeSO 4 is recommended. If it is not applied basally, foliar application of\\n1% FeSO4 at vegetative phase is recommended.\\nWater management: It is a highly drought tolerant cr op and water requirement is 300–350 mm.\\nIrrigation at available soil moisture of 50% or optimum IW/CPE ratio 0.4 is sufficient. The critical\\nstages are tillering and flowering. Normally 5 irrigations are recommended for the stages viz., tillering,\\npanicle initiation, flag leaf, flowering, dough stages in addition to sowing irrigation. Under limited\\nmoisture conditions, three irrigations can be recommended for panicle initiation, flag leaf and flowering\\nin addition to sowing irrigation.\\nThinning and gap filling: In the direct sown crop, after 1st weeding at the time of irrigation, gap\\nfilling and thinning is done to a spacing of 15 cm between plants. In rainfed crop, thinning should be\\ndone 10-15 DAS.\\nWeed management: Weed reduces the yield by 50%. Crop weed competition is up to 35 days.\\nPre-emergence application of atrazine at 500 g/ ha followed by hand weeding on 30–35 days after\\ntransplanting or sowing. If the herbicide is not used, weeding is done on 15th day and again between\\n30 and 35 days after transplanting. For direct sown crop, hoeing and weeding may be done on 20–25\\nDAS and second weeding on 35–40 DAS.

Dried edible seed of a cultivated legume is known\\nas pulse. Legume derived from Latin “legere” means “to gather”. It constitutes 10–12% of Indian diet.\\nWHO recommends 80 g/da y/person, whereas ICMR recorded 47 g but actual is 30–35 g. Pulses are\\nused as fodder, food crops, green manure, cov er crop and catch crop. N fixation by legumes improves\\nsoil fertility. The protein content ranges from 17–25% (Soybean = 40–43%). It provides thiamine,\\nriboflavin, niacin, vitamin B and ascorbic acid. Early maturity, relative thermo and photo insensitivity\\nand better canopy structure (non-spreading) makes the pulses to include them in multiple cropping.\\nArea and distribution: India accounts 33% area under pulses and 22% production of world. It is\\nmostly grown as rainfed and only 8% of pulse area is irrigated in India. Pulses are cultivated in an\\narea of 22.47 m.ha with 13.38 m.t production (2004–05). The pulse yield potential in India is\\n2500–3500 kg/ha but the productivity is 550–625 kg/ha as against 1600 kg in USA, 1400 kg in China\\nand world average is 900 kg/ha.\\nCauses for low production of pulses\\n(a) Ecological factors: Pulses are grown mostly under rain fed conditions and only 8% of the area\\nis irrigated and it depends on residual soil moisture. Pulses are sensitive to excess soil moisture,\\nsalinity, alkalinity and acidity.\\n(b) Lack of agronomic management : It is grown with poor management and lack of HYV\\n(HI-0.1–0.2 and but, for wheat, it is 0.5). Improper sowing time, inadequate seed rate and\\ndefective method of sowing are few examples.\\n(c) Basic research factors : Break through in production is possible if HYV/hybrid is developed\\nwith synchronous flowering, multiple resistance to pests and diseases and response to inputs.'),\n",

Origin\\nThere are two school of thoughts about its origin-one, it had or iginated in Africa and the other tracing\\nits origin to Brazil in South America (De Gandolle,1825). Its introduction in India is considered to be\\nthrough Jesuit Fathers (Missionaries) who followed Vasco De Gama in the first half of the 16th century.\\nThe production during 2003–04 was 81.82 m.t. with a productivity of 1364 kg/ha. But the produc-\\ntion was 64.76 m.t. during 2004–05.\\nB. Climate and Soil\\nGroundnut is a tropical crop, which requires a long and warm growing season while high rainfall,\\ndrought and cold weathers are extremely detrimental for better crop growth. Normally it needs about\\n70-90°F temperature during its growing period with cold nights at maturity. It can be grown well in\\ntracts, which receive an annual well distributed rainfall of 500–1250 mm. The best type of soil for\\ngroundnut cultivation is well drai ned, light coloured, loose, fria ble, sandy loam, well supplied with\\ncalcium and moderate amount of organic matter. Soils with poor drainage high acidity or alkalinity\\nmust be avoided for groundnut cultivation. A soil pH over 5.0 or below 8.5 is supposed to be an ideal\\nfor groundnut production. In Uttar Pradesh, it is grown in alluvial sandy to loam soil while in Madhya\\nPradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, the crop is taken in black cotton and red\\nsoils. Heavy clay is not fit for groundnut production because soil becomes very hard during drought,\\nwhich restricts pod formation and development. Even peg penetration becomes difficult.\\nC. Land Preparation\\nFor good germination and higher pod yields, it is essential to get a weed free well pulverized, open and\\naerated seed-bed for sowing. The field must be thoroughly leveled to avoid water logging in any part\\nof the field. A required tilth may be obtained by ploughing twice with country plough or disc plough/\\nmould board plough followed by two harrowings and planking. If the field is infested with white grubs,\\nchemicals like Heptachlor or Chlordane should be drilled at  25 kg/ha before the final har rowing.

Organic manures\\nlike FYM or compost at 6.25 t under rainfed and 12.5 t/ha under irrigated conditions, if to be applied,\\nshould be spread and mixed well in the soil at least 15–20 days before sowing.

In case of very light soils, the N should be applied in two splits i.e., half\\nat sowing and half (top dressing as band placed) 30 DAS or at the time of last intercultivation. It is\\nobserved that Andhra Pradesh soils are deficient in B and Mo whereas north Indian soils are deficient\\nin S, Zn and Ca. These deficiencies may be corrected by application of 5 kg Borax, 1.0 kg Ammonium\\nmolybdate, 15–20 kg of Zinc sulphate and 200–500 kg of gypsum/ha. Of these, Borax and Ammonium\\nmolybdate should be applied as basal while gypsum should be band placed near roots 30 DAS. These\\nnutrients should be applied in the zone of pod development as they are directly absorbed by the\\ndeveloping pods. To tide over surface crusting, application of lime at 2 t/ha along with FYM or coir pith\\nat 12.5 t/ha is recommended. In Tamil Nadu, if the soil test is done, a blanket fertilizer recommendation\\nof 10:10:45 kg of NPK for rainfed crop and 17:34:54 kg of NPK for irriga ted crop is recommended.\\nE. Seed Quality\\nTo ensure good stand, uniform maturity, high yield and better quality produce, one has to be careful\\nabout the seed quality. The seed must be pure, viable,  uniform in size and free from the seed bone\\ndiseases. The seeds should not be broken or damaged by any means. It is better to use hand shelled\\nkernels but if large area is to be sown, groundnut sheller may be used. The germination of the seed\\nshould be checked and the seed not having over 90 per cent germination should be selected for sowing.\\nIt is observed that the ger mination in case of bunch type is always higher (90–95 per cent) than the\\nspreading type (85–90 per cent). To ensure the freedom of seed from seed borne diseases, the kernels\\nmust be treated with captan or Thiram (Slurry made by mixing 125 g Thiram/100 kg kernel in 500 ml\\nof water). It is observed that some of spreading varieti es have a dormancy of 60–75 days before they\\ngerminate. Therefore, in case of the freshly harvested kernels are to be used for sowing within the\\ndormancy period, the kernels should be treated with some ger mination promoting hormones like GA\\netc.\\nSeed treatment: It is advised that, when groundnut is to be introduced in some new areas where\\nit was never grown, the kernels should be treated with Rhizobium culture for better nodulation, growth\\nand development of the crop. For 50 kg of kernels, prepare 10% solution of gum Arabic in water, add\\ngur (Jaggary) to make a solution of 5%. When it is dissolved, add 2–3 packets (200 g each) of peat\\nbased culture, pour the groundnut kernels and agitate the content to make a slurry. When all the kernels\\nhave had an uniform coating of the slurry, spread them out on newspaper sheets in the shade. Reject the\\nleft over slurry after use and sow the seeds when they ha ve dried completely. In Tamil Nadu, the seeds\\nare treated with Trichoderma at 4 g/kg of seeds (or) with Thiram at 4 g/kg of seeds.\\nF. Sowing\\n(i) Time of sowing: In north India, groundnut is grown during kharif (April-July under irrigated con-\\nditions and between June 20 and July 31 under rain fed conditions). In Tamil Nadu, the crop is sown\\nfrom May to July where as in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, it is sown between January and March. The\\nseason and varieties for Tamil Nadu conditions are given below:\\nRain fed\\nChittirai pattam (April–May) - VRI 2, 3, JL24, CO 2, TMV2\\nEarly Adipattam (June–July) - TMV 2, VRI3, VRI4\\nLate Adipattam (July–Aug) - JL 24, VRI2\\nAippasipattam (Oct) - JL24, VRI2.'),\n",

In Tamil Nadu, the seed rate for irrigated crop is 125 kg of Kernels/ha and it is 140 kg of\\nKernels/ha for rainfed crop.\\n(iii) Method of sowing: It is sown either by dibbling the seeds behind the plough or by using a seed\\ndrill. In case of irrigated crop, it is better to prepar e ridges and furrows and dibble the seeds on ridges.\\nIn case of rainfed light soils, the crop is sown in flat beds. Form 10 m2–20 m2 beds depending upon the\\navail of water, slope and soil type. Bed former may also be engaged. The groundnut seeds should be\\nsown at a depth of 5–8 cm in light soils and 4-6 cm in case of moderate to heavy soil types. To ensure\\na good and proper ge rmination a light covering with soil is required over the seed. Sometimes rodents\\nand crows are noticed to take away the seeds from the field, therefore, use of some repellants like pine\\ntar and kerosene for seed treatment are recommended, but care should be taken to avoid any injury to\\nthe kernels.\\n(iv) Spacing: It varies according to irrigation facilities and type of seed. In bunch type and rainfed\\ncrop, the spacing of 20–30 × 8–10 cm is followed. The spacing for semi-spreading and spreading types\\nwith irrigation facilities is 30–40 cm × 10–15 cm and 50 cm × 15–20 cm respectively. The spacing for\\nground nut in Tamil Nadu is 30 × 10 cm.\\nG. Irrigation\\nGenerally groundnut is grown as a rainfed crop during kharif season though its water requirement\\nvaries from 500–700 mm but if crop is caught in a long spell of drought, especially at the pod formation\\nstage, supplemental irrigation is given. In case of irrigated crop, the fr equency of irri gation depends\\nupon soil texture and the interval between the irriga tions ranges between 8–12 days. The critical stage\\nfor irrigation is flowering pegging and pod formation. Giving two irrigations during flowering, two\\nirrigations during pegging and 2–3 irrigations during pod development stages is done. There should be\\nsufficient moisture at the sowing time in the field, thus if the crop is to be sown before onset of monsoon\\nthe field should be given one light pre-sowing irrigation for better germination, followed by life irriga-\\ntion on 4–5 DAS. The winter and summer crops are always grown under assured irrigation. The irriga-\\ntion must be stopped about 20–25 days prior to maturity.\\nH. Weed Management\\nWeeds may cause reduction in the yield to the extent of 20–40% based on nature of weed infestations\\nin the field. To kept the soil loose and friable and the field free from weeds, the crop should be given\\na hand weeding 20–25 DAS and one or two hoeing—the first at the time of weeding and second about\\na fortnight later. The intercultural operations should be stopped after the pegs have started going into\\nthe soil. The bunch and semi spreading types should be given a light earthing to facilitate the maximum\\npenetration of the pegs into the soil. For weed control pr oblem, application of TOK-E-25 or Lasso at\\n5 l of commercial material dissolved in 500 litres of water as pre-emergence soil spray within 2–3 DAS\\nis done. In Tamil Nadu, pre sowing or pre emergence application of Fluchloralin at 2.0 litre/ha followed\\nby one hand weeding on 35–45 DAS is recommended. If herbicides are not applied, two hand hoeing\\non 20 and 40 DAS is recommended.'),\n",

Mixed Cropping\\nIt is growing with several erect growing crops like bajra, arhar, castor, sesame, cotton, maize, sunflower\\netc. The number of groundnut rows between two rows of any of the said crops depends upon their inter-\\nrow spacing and type groundnut, i.e., bunch, semi-spreading or spreading to be grown.\\nGypsum application: Gypsum should be applied at 400 kg/ha on 40–45 DAS for intercropping\\nand 40–70 DAS depending upon moisture. Hoeing and incorporating it is done, followed by earthing\\nup. Gypsum encourages pod formation and better filling of up of the pods.\\nJ. Use of Hormones\\nUse of hormone was not very much practical in the past but with the advancement of the production\\ntechnology now application of certain hormones has become a common practice. Seeding the growth\\nbehaviour of the crop we find that groundnut usually suffers from two drawbacks—the first is that the\\ncrop being non-determinate keeps on flowering and pr oduction of pegs simultaneously until maturity\\nand the second is that the pods start ger minating at once after reaching physiological maturity, if they\\nget water. As a result and effective pods germinate if there is rain or irrigation. Thus both the conditions\\nlead to very poor yield and quality of the crop. Application of L-NAA in the form of planofix and\\nV aardhak at 20 ppm at the time of flowering is done to reduce the excessive vegetative growth and\\nflowering period which ultimately increases the number of effective pods/plant, test weight and the\\nyield/unit area. It has also been observed that t heir two applications at lower concentration are better\\nthan one application at higher concentration. The most ideal time for application is 40–80 DAS.\\nApplication of MH (Maleic hydrozide) near maturity results in inducing dormancy in the pods for about\\n20–30 days which checks the germination of matured pods even if they get water. However, the chemical\\nbeing very expensive is not commonly applied.\\nK. Harvesting\\nYellowing of leaves is the prominent symptom of matur ity. The leaf yellowing is associated with leaf\\nshedding (particularly, the older ones), development of proper colour of shell and a dark tint on the\\ninner side of the shells. It is better to observe the cr op duration. Usually the crop takes about 120–140\\ndays time to matur e depending upon the variety and the harvesting is done in the month of October-\\nNovember accordingly. At maturity, the crop is badly damaged by crows, jackals, pigs etc. which need\\nvigilance. After maturity, the bunch and semi-spreading types are generally harvested by hand pulling\\nat an appropriate soil moisture, while the spreading types are harvested by digging out the plants with\\nthe help of khurpi, spade or by ploughing the field. The left out pods in the soil are collected by hand,\\nlater. The pulled out plants are stacked in a safe place for a few days to dry and are stripped afterwards.\\nThe stripped pods are cleaned nicely and dried to a safe moisture content of not more than 5% before\\nthey are stored because dampness will cause fermentation of pods and allow to develop the poisonous\\nmoulds like Aspergillus flavus in the kernel. These moulds lead to contamination with afflotoxin which\\ncreate a health hazard to both human and cattle who c onsume the kernels. Ground strippers are also\\nused for separating pods from the plant.\\nL. Yield\\nThe pod yield is controlled by several factors like climate, soil and varietal potentiality. In general, the\\nirrigated groundnut crop produces about 30–35 q pods/ha and rain fed about 15–20 q pods/ha. The\\nyield of haulms is usually two to two and half times of pods’ yield. The shelling percentage ranges\\nbetween 70-75% and the kernels have on an average 45–50% oil in them.'),\n",

Post Harvest Technology\\nDrying: Generally, moisture in pods is found to be around or excess of 40% (on wet basis) depend-\\ning upon stage of maturity at harvest. The pods must be dried to 5-10% moisture for safe storage and\\nfor preventing molding and other forms of deterioration. It helps in maintenance of the desirable\\nflavour, texture, germination and viability of kernels etc.\\nStorage: All the damaged or injured pods must be sorted out before they are stored.

SUNFLOWER (Helianthus annuus L.)\\nSunflower production in India during 2003–04, was 991000 t with a productivity of 496 kg/ha, but\\nduring 2004–05, the production was 12.41 m.t. Sunflower has three sub-species viz., H. annus var.\\nmacrocarpus (DC), H. annus var. lenticularis  (Dough) and H. annus var . jaegeri (Heiser) which are\\ncultivated ones. The wild species are H. anomalus, H. orgophllus, H. bolanderi, H. deblis sp. Bedlis, H.\\ndeserticola, H. neglectus, H. riveus sp. Conesceus, H. paradoxus, H. periolasis, H. praccex sp. (hirtus,\\npraecox, runyonii), H. mutalli (All having no. = 17 chromosomes) and H. tuberosus (51 chromosomes).\\nSunflower cultivars vary greatly in plant height, time of maturity, number, diameter and colour of\\nheads; size, shape, colour, oil and husk content of seeds and suitability for different climates. Thus, the\\ncultivars may be divided into following types:\\n1. Giant types: 180–420 cm tall, late maturing, heads 30–35 cm in diameter, seeds large, white or\\ngrey with lower oil content, variety–‘Mammoth Russian’.\\n2. Semi Dwarf types: 130–180 cm tall, early maturing, heads 18–24 cm in diameter; seeds smaller,\\nblack/grey, higher oil content, variety–‘Pole Star’, Jupiter.\\n3. Dwarf types:  60–130 cm tall, early maturing, heads 12–17 cm in diameter, seeds small, highest\\noil content, variety–‘advance’, ‘sunrise’ etc.\\nA. Varietal Improvement\\nIn India, heterosis breeding was initiated in early seventies over better parents for yield and yield\\ncomponents involving CMS lines and restorers Hybrid 1 (BSH 1) and BSH 2 evolved at Bangalore\\nshowed yield stability under various agro climatic zones of the country. Subsequently 1980 BSH 1 was\\nreleased for commercial cultivation. The hybrids have following advantage over open pollinated vari-\\neties:\\n\\x7f Hybrids have high yield potential and are responsive to higher inputs.\\n\\x7f They are superior in their seed filling ability and are comparatively more self fertile.\\n\\x7f They are more tolerant to diseases and pests and have higher drought tolerance.\\nB. Seed Dormancy and Viability\\nThe sunflower seeds (achenes) remain dormant up to 40–45 days of harvesting however, the dehusked\\nseeds may germinate from 10th day after harvest. Exogenous application of ethrel, benzyl adevine and\\nGA promotes germination of achenes. Pre-soaking of dormant seeds with ethrel solution (25 ppm)\\nequivalent to 40% by volume of seeds has been found to be optimum. T he soaking period may vary\\nfrom 6 to 24 hrs. The achenes should be dried in shade and then may be sown directly. Usually\\nsunflower seeds remain viable for 10–12 months but under hot humid conditions, the seeds lose viabil-'),\n",

At 50–85% relative humidity, seeds lose viability even under high humidity conditions.\\nShort-terms seed hardening treatment given to 6 month old seeds extends viability up to 10 months.\\nC. Advantages of Sunflower Cultivation\\nBeing a short duration, it can be well suited as catch crop. It is a drought, frost and salt tolerant crop.\\nThere is very slow degeneration in seed quality hence the same seed can be sued for sowing up to\\n4–5 years. Being thermo and photo insensitive, it can be grown any time in the age, year, in any part\\nof the country and under any type of cropping system. Sunflower is a useful crop for apiculture (bee\\nkeeping) as it attracts the bees and provides them nectar. The rainy season sunflower is mostly grown\\nas rain fed crop in which few crops like groundnut (2:6), ragi (2:5), cowpea or black gram (2:3) may\\nbe successfully intercropped.\\nD. Season\\nSunflower, being photo and thermo non-sensitive , can be grown thrice in a year i.e., rabi (October/\\nNovember), zaid (January/February) and kharif (June/July). The season and varieties for Tamil Nadu\\ncondition are given below:\\nRain fed\\nAdipattam (June-July) - K 1, K2, CO1, CO2, EC 68415\\nKarthigai pattam (October–November) - K 1, K2, CO1, CO2, Modern\\nIrrigated\\nApril–May - K 1, K2, CO1, CO2, EC 68415, Modern\\nDecember - January - K 1, K2, CO1, CO2, EC 68415, Modern\\nE. Seed Treatment\\nThe seeds are treated with Captan or Dithane or Thir am or Brasicol @ 2 g/kg of seed before sowing.\\nF. Field Preparation\\nGenerally sunflower is grown as a rain fed crop in kharif, hence to make use of rain water, it is\\nnecessary to plough the land once by a mould-board plough followed by harrowing soon after the onset\\nof the rains. The crop pref ers deep fertile soil adequately supplied with moisture without producing\\nwater logged conditions that adversely affects the germination of seed. In Tamil Nadu, the sunflower is\\nraised in ridges and furrows of 6 m long and the seeds are placed at 3 cm depth (two seeds per hole)\\nalong the furrows in which the fertilizer mixture is placed and the soil is covered.\\nG. Sowing and Seed Rate\\nSeeds having over 70% germination and 80 g test weight (of 1,000 seeds) would be sown at 8–10 kg/\\nha rate in spacing of 45–60 cm × 20–25 cm. In Tamil Nadu, the seed rate for varieties is 15 kg/ha and\\nfor CO 1, it is 30 kg/ha. In order to have a stand of 80,000 healthy plants/ha thinning or gap filling is\\nrequired during early stage of crop growth.\\nH. Manuring\\nAfter leveling the land, fertilizer @60:40:20 kg/ha of NPK respectively for low fertility and 40:30:20\\nkg/ha of NPK respectively for high fertility soils should be applied and mixed properly with the soil.\\nThe IARI however, recommends 40:60:20 kg/ha NPK respectively. To increase the efficiency of nitro-\\ngen, 60% of nitrogen may be applied as basal and the remaining top dressed on 40 DAS. Increase in'),\n",

In Tamil Nadu, the following is the manuring schedule:\\n\\x7f Application of 12.5 t/ha of FYM or compost or composted coir pith evenly on the field before\\nthe last ploughing.\\n\\x7f Basal application of 40:20:20 kg NPK/ha for both irrigated and rain fed crops.\\n\\x7f Soil application of Azospirillum (10 pack et -2000 g/ha) with 25 kg FYM or soil after sowing.\\n\\x7f Application of micronutrient at 12.5 kg/ha with enough sand to make a total quantity of\\n50 kg/ha on the furrows.\\nI. Weed Management\\nThe crop should be kept weed free upto 45 days of sowing. Mechanical weeding twice at 20–25 and at\\n30–35 DAS are recommended for effective control of weeds. In labour scarcity areas, pre-emergence\\napplication of TOK-E-25 @ 1.5–2 kg a.i./ha or Pr ometryne @ 1.0 kg a.i/ha or Alachlor @ 1.5 kg\\na.i/ha may be done for economical and efficient control of weeds. In Tamil Nadu, application of\\nFluchloralin at 2.0 l/ha or pendimethalin at 2.5 lit/ha as pre-emergence spray followed by one hand\\nweeding on 30–35 DAS is recommended.\\nJ. Irrigation\\nThe crop being drought resistant, may very w ell be grown under rain fed conditions. However, under\\nirrigated conditions, one or two irrigations are required to increase the yield, although germination,\\nflowering and dough stages are critical for irrigation. In Tamil Nadu,  Irrigation is given immediately\\nafter sowing, followed by an irrigation on 4th–5th DAS and later at intervals of 7–8 days.\\nK. Plant Protection\\nThe crop does not have serious insect-pest and disease problems. To control leaf caterpillars, leaf\\nweevils, Heliothis and thrips, spraying Endosulf an (35 EC) or phosalone (35 EC) at 1000 ml/ha is\\nrecommended. The attack of grass hopper s at seedling stage and green bug at flowering stage can be\\ncontrolled by dusting 10% BHC @ 30 kg/ha. Spraying Mancozeb 1 kg/ha for the control of alternaria\\nleaf spot and spot drenching of carbendazium at 5 g/10 lit. of water for the control of charcoal rot is\\nrecommended. Sunflower is essentially a cross-pollinated crop. So, selection of suitable insecticide that\\nis not harmful to pollination may be selected. Birds are a menace during seed formation stage and\\nconstant vigilance to scare them away is necessary.\\nL. Hand-pollination\\nSunflower is a self-incompatible and depends on insects (mainly bees) for cross-pollination and seed-\\nset, therefore, it is essential that adequate pollinators are present in the field, for pollen movement and\\nseed-set. Otherwise the heads bear chaffy and partiall y filled seeds resulting into drastic reduction in\\nyield and quality of the produce. Keeping bee hives at 5/ha in the field increases crop yield. Hand-\\npollination gives an increase in the crop yield to the extent of 18–25%. Hand-pollination could be done\\nby gentle rubbing of the sunflower heads with palm or with soft muslin clothes during flowing period\\nbetween 7 and 11 am on alternate days for about two weeks.\\nM. Harvesting\\nAt maturity, the back of the floral heads and outer bracts turn yellow and then to brown colour respec-\\ntively. The heads (capitula) harvested from the plants are dried for 3 days by spreading the heads in thin\\nlayer and turning them once in 3 hours and after the drying, threshing and cleaning is done to separate'),\n",

Seeds when harvested at 8–10% moisture level, have better keeping quality and higher oil\\ncontent. The stalks may be used as fuel or for making high quality compost. One ha should yield\\n20–25 q sunflower seed. The seeds should be bagged at 6% moisture level for better keeping quality\\nand germination.

RAPE AND MUSTARD (Brassica Sp.)\\nRape seed and mustard production in India during 2003–04 was 61.98 m.t. with productivity of\\n1151 kg/ha, but during 2003–04, the production was 75.39 m.t.\\nA. Climate and Soil\\nIn India, rape and mustard is grown during winter season and it is observed that the crop needs about\\n18°C–25°C temperature, low humidity, practically no rain especially at the time of flowering. Rainfall,\\nhigh humidity practically no rain especially at the time of flowering. Rainfall, high humidity and cloudy\\nweather are not good for the crop during winter as it invites aphids and the crop gets spoiled completely.\\nHowever, under rain fed conditions, one to two pre-flowering rains help in boosting the grain yield.\\nExcessive cold and frost ar e harmful to the crop.\\nGenerally the rape and mustards thrive best in medium or heavy loam soils. Though the crop is\\ngrown during winter seasons and there is very little chance of water logging but still due to heavy winter\\nrains, the water may get accumulated and cause a temporary water lo gging. Very light soils usually\\ncause a serious moisture stress and a poor crop growth is observed. Saline and alkaline soils are often\\nnot fit for the crop though it has good tolerance to such conditions.\\nB. Preparation of Land\\nIt requires a fine, firm, moist seedbed so that a reliable moisture supply is assured for germinating seeds\\nand young seedlings. For this, the field should be given one pre-sowing irrigation if there is less\\nmoisture in the field. The field should be given a deep ploughing soon after the kharif crop is harvested\\nin middle of September. Thereafter, it may be ploughed for 3–4 times with desi plough and planking\\nafter each ploughing. The crop and weed stubbles along with established weeds should be picked up\\nand thrown out of the field. In dry land areas where pre-sowing irrigation is not possible, the seed may\\nbe spread in damp place at night and next morning it should be sown. It increases the germination\\npercentage of the seeds.\\nC. Time of Sowing\\nSowing time is very important as the attack of aphids and the extent of damage can be reduced consid-\\nerably by sowing the crop earlier or before middle of November. Toria must be sown between mid and'),\n",

Seed Rate\\nA pure crop of mustard and rape seed needs about 6–7.5 kg/ha and toria needs 4–5 kg/ha, while mixed\\nor intercrop of mustard requires about 2.5–3 kg seed/ha however, seed rate in case of mixed crop\\ndepends on its proportionate area to the main crop. The depth of seeding should not exceed 3 cm and\\nthe seeds are treated with thiram or captan @ 2.5 g/kg bef ore sowing.\\nE. Method of Sowing\\nLine sowing is better than broadcasting, although broadcasting in case of high moisture conditions is\\ncommon especially for ‘toria’ crop. Thus, it may be sown in shallow furrows behind desi plough or\\nthrough seed drill or ‘mala basa’.\\nF. Spacing\\nA spacing of 40–45 cm × 15 cm is recommended for rai and lotani sarson but 30 cm × 10–15 cm is\\nrecommended for yellow sarson and tora brown sarson. Sowing mustard in parallel rows 150–200 cm\\napart alternating with the main crop is recommended as a mixed crop with wheat. However, broadcast-\\ning of mixed seed is still in practice but it gives a poor seed yield.\\nG. Manuring\\nIt is grown with nominal use or no use of fertilizers under rainfed condition. It is better that the soil of\\nthe selected field should be analyzed and application be made accordingly. If it is not done, application\\nof only basal dose of 50–60 kg N/ha is sufficient for the rainfed crop. Indian mustard varieties of B.\\nnapus and B. juncea have a very short growing season and, therefore, their N requirement is very low,\\nhowever, the mustard, sarson have shown better response up to 100–150 kg N/ha. It is advisable to\\napply about half at sowing time and rest at about 30 days after sowing, when thinning, weeding and first\\nirrigation are over. A dose 60–100 kg N, 40–60 kg P 2O5 and 40 kg K 2O per hectare may be recom-\\nmended for long duration varieties. Regarding the mode of application it has been found that half of\\nnitrogen with entire dose of phosphate and potash should be basal placed about 5–7 cm below the seed\\nor by the side of the seed and remaining half of the nitrogen should be top-dressed about 30–35 DAS,\\nwhile for ‘toria’ or short duration varieties 40–60 kg N, 20–30 kg P2O5 and 20 kg K 2O/ha has been\\nfound to be good dose which should be basal placed.\\nVariety Nutrients in kg/ha Method of application\\nNPK\\nEarly Torai/Lahi 30–50 25 – All basal\\nMustard/Sarson(irrigated) 80–150 60 – H alf basal + half top-dressing at 30–35 DAS\\nMustard/Sarson (Rain fed) 40–60 25 20 All basal pl aced\\nTaramire (Rain fed) 30–40 20 – All basal\\nIn general, the following doses are found to be optimum:\\nRain fed: An amount of 40 kg/ha N along with 15 kg of P and K both for all rapeseed and mustard\\ncrops.\\nIrrigated: An amount of 40, 60 and 80 kg/ha N are considered optimum for ‘toria’, ‘sarson’ and'),\n",

Termites and cutworms usually attack the crop, therefore, Aldrin or Chlordane 5% dust should be\\nmixed in the soil at 25–30 kg/ha at the time of last ploughing.\\nD. Seed and Sowing\\nIn rain fed areas, the crop is sown earlier in last week of Se ptember or mid of October when the rains\\nhave stopped so that best use of residual moisture of rains be made but in case of irrigated areas, the\\ncrop may be sown little la ter in October-November by giving one light  pre-sowing irrigation. Broad-\\ncasting of the seeds should be avoided and it should be sown in lines either behind the country plough\\nin shallow furrows or by the seed drill. In Bihar and eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh, the linseed is\\nbroadcasted in standing rice crop as relay crop dur ing September-October. (This system of sowing is\\ncalled as paira or Utera cropping)  which occupies nearly 25% of total area under linseed crop but in\\ncase of mixed cropping of linseed with wheat, gram and barley, it is sown in rows after every few lines\\nof aforesaid crops. In case of pure crop of linseed, a row to row spacing of 20–30 cm is given and a seed\\nrate of 20–30 kg/ha in case of line sowing and 35–40 kg/ha in case of broadcasting is required.\\nE. Seed Treatment\\nThe seeds are treated with Bavistin/Topsin @ 2 g/kg seed or Agrosan GN or Thiram @ 3g/kg of seed\\nbefore sowing.\\nF. Fertilizer Application\\nNormally, the rainfed crop is grown under unfertilized condition of residual fertility or under very poor\\nfertilizer doses. But, in case of rain fed crop, the placement of 20–30 kg each of N and P2O5 but in case\\nof irrigated crop, a dose of 30–40 kg of each of N and P 2O5 per ha is recommended . When linseed is\\nto be sown as relay cropping in standing rice cr op, top dressing with onl y 10–15 kg N/ha would be\\nenough. In irrigated condition, top dressing with half of the required N is more beneficial.'),\n",

Irrigation\\nUnder irrigated conditions the crop should be given two light irrigations—first 35 DAS and second 65\\nDAS.\\nI. Plant Protection\\nGall midge is controlled by spraying 0.3 % Metasystox or Dimecron or Rogor. The spraying should be\\ndone two-three times at 10 days interval starting from appearance of the insect in the crop. To manage\\ndiseases like wilt and rust, the resistant varieties like R-552, K-2, LC-54, LC-185 as wilt resistant and\\nR-7, R-17, R-552, LC-54, K-2, LC-185 as rust resistant should be selected and grown.

The\\npowdery mildew and alternaria blight ma y be controlled by spraying of sulphur (0.3%) or Karathane\\n(0.2%) or aulfex (0.2%).\\nJ. Harvesting, Yield and Storage\\nThe crop should be harvested at red ripe stage but when fibre and grains both are to be taken from the\\nsame crop then harvesting at physiological maturity or pod maturity should be done when the plants are\\nlittle green. The crop is traditionally harvested by sickles and threshing is done by beating the plants\\nwith wooden mallets or by trampling them under bu llock’s feet. It usually produces about 4–5 q/ha\\nunder mixed cropping but the yield is about 10–12 q/ha when gro wn as pure crop. The seeds contain\\n36–42% oil and they may be stored at 10–12% moisture.\\n4. NIGER (Guizotia abyssinica L.f. Cass)\\nThe crop is grown to yield oil ranging between 37 and 43%. The oil is used for culinary purposes and\\nmanufacturing paints, soft soaps etc. In India, it is grown in about 4.8 lakh ha which produces about\\n1.11 lakh t of seeds. The productivity during 2003–04 was 253 kg/ha. It is grown in Madhya Pradesh,\\nBihar, Maharashtra, Orissa and Tamil Nadu and partly in Uttar Pradesh also. The Niger is a kharif crop,\\nwhich should be grown at 30 cm × 10–15 cm. T he seed rate is about 7–8 kg seed/ha. It requires about\\n20 kg of both N and P 2O5/ha.

Best oil palm yields are obtained in places where\\na maximum average temperature of 29–33°C and minimum average temperature of 22–24°C. Higher\\ndiurnal temperature variation causes floral abor tion in regions with a dry season. Constant sunlight of\\nat least 5 hrs/day is required for better oil palm yield and it grows well on moist, deep and well drained\\nmedium textured soils rich in humus content.\\nB. Nursery\\nPotting mixture is made by mixing topsoil, sand and well decomposed cattle manure in equal propo-\\nsitions. Poly bags of 500 gauge and 40 × 40 cm size preferably black colour are used for raising primary\\nnurseries. A healthy germinated sprout is placed at the center at 2.5 cm depth. On the lower half of the\\nbag, perforations are made at an interval of 7.5 cm for drainage. It is important to provide shade until\\nseedling attains two leaf stage. The water requirement for different stages of growth of seedling is as\\nfollows.\\n0–2 months at 4 mm/day\\n2–4 months at 5 mm/day\\n4–6 months at 7 mm/day\\n6–8 months at 10 mm/day\\nA well developed tenera seedling with a height of 1–1.3 m from base and more than 13 functional\\nleaves of 12–14 months of age is selected, since this seedling is found to maintain higher leaf produc-\\ntion, bear earlier, produce heavy bunches, give higher fruit/bunch ratio and a higher oil to mesocarp in\\nthe first year of harvest.\\nC. Transplanting\\nMost suitable time for transplanting seedling in main field in India is with the onset of monsoon.\\nOptimum plant population recommended is 140 seedlings/ha with a spacing 9 m × 9 m × 9 m in\\nTriangular system of planting. Pits of 60 cm are taken prior to planting and filled with surrounding top\\nsoil and allowed to settle. In the refilled and root zone soil, a depression sufficient to cover the ball of\\nearth is made at the time of planting. Rock phosphate is applied at 200 g/pit. N and K are usually\\napplied 4–6 weeks after planting. Replanting is carr ied out during the onset of next monsoon. These\\npalms are to be given special care so that they can catch up with the rest of the plantation.\\nD. Ablation\\nThe bunches produced initially will be very small and have low oil content. Removal of such inflores-\\ncence is called ablation or castration. Ablation is done at monthly interval by pulling out the young\\ninflorescence using gloves or with the help of devices such as narrow bladed chisels. Ablation improves\\ndrought resistance capacity of young palms by improving shoot and root growth especially in low\\nproduction areas where dry condition exist.\\nE. Pruning of Leaves\\nIn oil palm, two leaves are produced per month. Therefore, it becomes necessary to prune excess leaves\\nso as to gain access to bunches for harvest. Severe priming will adversely affect both growth and yield\\nof palm, cause abortion of female flowers and also reduce the size of the leaves. Pruning is carried out\\nin India using chisels, preferably at the end of the rainy season and low crop season when labourers are\\nalso available.'),\n",

Weed Management\\nThe basin area of oil palm is kept free of weed growth through ring weeding. It is more important for\\nyoung palms, roots of which are to be kept free from competition from weed. Depending on the extent\\nof weed growth and rainfall, hand weeding is carried out even up to 4 times in a year during early years\\nof plantation, which is progressively reduced to two times a year.\\nG. Water Management\\nOil palm needs 1200–1500 mm of water to meet its monthly evapotranspiration needs. In areas where\\nperennial water source is available, basin irrigation is possible. But where Terrain is undulating and\\nwater is scare during summer months, drip irrigation is recommended to keep four drippers/palm in the\\nweeded palm circle to supply at least 90 litres of water/palm/day during summer months.\\nH. Fertilizer Management\\nSupply of sufficient quantity of green leaves or compost is advantageous especially where the soil is\\npoor in organic matter content. The fertilizer schedule is given below:\\nNutrients (gram/palm/year)\\nAge N P K\\nFirst year 400 200 400\\nSecond year 800 400 800\\nThird year onwards 1200 600 1200\\nThe fertilizers are preferably applied in two equal split doses during May-June and September-\\nOctober by uniformly spreading them within a 2 m circle around the base of the palm and incorporate\\nthem into the soil.\\nI. Pest Management\\nTo control rhinoceros beetle, Sevin 10% D at the 200 g admixed with equal quantity of sand is to be\\napplied at the leaf base. Placing 3-4 naphthalene balls in the youngest spear axils at weekly intervals\\nmay be done.\\nJ. Harvesting\\nProper and timely harvesting of fruit bunches is an important operation which determine the quality of\\noil. The yield is expressed as fresh fruit bunc hes (FFB) in kg/ha/year or as oil/ha/year. The bunches\\nusually ripen in six month after anthesis. Unripe fr uits contain high water and carbohydrate and very\\nlittle oil. As the fruit ripens, oil content increased to 80–85% in mesocarp. Ripeness of the fruit is\\ndetermined by the degree of detachment of the fruit from branches, change in colour and change in\\ntexture of the fruit.\\n6. COCONUT (Cocos nucifera)\\nCoconut in grown in 93 countries in the world. Indonesia (32.20%) ranks first among the major coconut\\nproducing countries followed by Philippines (26.65%) and India (15.91%). India, Indonesia, Philippines\\nand Sri Lanka together account for 78.27% of global coconut production.

In the pits, Lindane 10% dust may be sprinkled to prevent\\nwhite ant damage. The pit should be filled to a height of one foot with FYM, red earth and sand mixed\\nin equal proportions. At the centre, the seedling should be planted after removing all the roots. The soil\\naround the nut should be pressed well and the seedling should be provided with shade by using plaited\\ncoconut leaves or palmyra leaves.\\nWater management: In the first year, irrigation is given on alternate days and from the second\\nyear, till the time of maturity, irrigation should be given twice a week and afterwards once in 10 days.\\nDuring summer months and also whenever there is no rain, irrigation is a must, depending upon soil\\nmoisture. Coconut requires about 100 l/day/tree through drip irrigation for matured plantation. The\\ncoconut husks at about 30 cm depth around the coconut trees at a radius of 1 m and covering it up with\\nearth will conserve soil moisture in light textured soil. Use of coir waste as soil mulch around the tree\\nto a thickness of about 3 cm is also advantageous to conserve soil moisture especially under scarcity\\ncondition. Drip irrigation is the best method of irrigation for coconut. Pitcher irrigation under severe\\nwater scarce condition (4 pitcher/tree) may be followed.\\nManuring: For a five year old palm, 50 kg compost or FYM or green leaves, 1.3 kg urea\\n(560 g N), 2 kg super phosphate (320 g P 2O5) and 2 kg muriate of potash (1200 g K 2O) should be\\napplied in 1.8 m circular basin, incorporated in soil and the basin is irrigated.

Rejuvenation of ex isting garden: The low yield in vast majority of gardens is due to thick\\npopulation, lack of manuring and irrigation. T hese gardens could be impr oved if the following\\nmeasures are taken.\\n(i) Thinning of thickly populated gardens: In the farmer’s holdings, 41 per cent of the trees\\ngive a yield of less than 20 nuts/palm/year. By cutting and removal of these trees, the yield\\ncould be increased by 1750 nuts/ha. Besides, there is saving in the cost of cultivation and\\nincrease in net profit to the tune of Rs. 2000/ha. After removal of low yielding trees, the\\npopulations should be maintained at 175–200 palms/ha.\\n(ii) Ensuring adequate manuring and irrigation: Research results have shown that the yield\\nof coconut palms could be increased by 23 nuts/palms/year by applying the manurial schedule\\nof 50 kg of FYM or green leaf plus NPK at 560, 320, 1200 g/palm. When irrigation at\\n10 days interval is also given during summer months in addition to manuring, the yield\\nincrease was 44 nuts/palm and when all these were  combined (manuring + irrigation +\\ncultural practices), the yield increase was 67 nuts/tree over control.\\n2.

If the\\nsoil pH is less than 5.5, it is an indication of excess acidity. This could be rectified by adding\\nlime. Increase in alkalinity is indicated by soil pH higher than 8.0. This situation could be\\nrectified by adding gypsum.\\n(b) Providing adequate drainage facilities : Lack of drainage r esults in the roots of coconut trees\\ngetting suffocated for want of aeration. Shedding of buttons occur under such condition. Drain-\\nage channels have to be dug along the contours to drain the excess wa ter during rainy season.\\n(c) Burial of coconut husk or coir waste : Severe drought condition and lack of irrigation during\\nsummer result in button shedding. To rectify the situation coconut husks may be buried @ 100\\nhusks with concave surface facing upwards or 25 kg of coir waste in semi circular trenches, dug\\nto one foot width and two feet depth at 1.5 m radius. This may be applied at the bottom and the\\nusual manures and fertilizers applied above this la yer, when there is moisture in the soil. The\\nmonsoon rains are preserved by the soaking of the coconut husk or coir waste as the case may\\nbe. Besides decomposition, of these materials provide addition of potash to the coconut.\\n(d) Genetic causes: In some trees, button shedding may persist even after ensuring adequate crop\\npest and disease management. This is an indication of inherent defect of the mother palm from\\nwhich the seed material was obtained. This underlines the need for proper choice of superior\\nmother palm for harvesting seed coconut to ensure uniformly good yielding trees.\\n(e) Lack of nutrition: Button shedding occurs due to inadequate or lack of manuring. The recom-\\nmended dose of manurial schedules and proper time of application are important to minimize\\nthe button shedding. Apply extra 2 kg of K2O with 200 g of Borax/palm over and above the usual\\ndosage of fertilizer to correct the barren nuts in coconut.\\n(f) Lack of pollination: Button shedding also occurs due to lack of pollination. Setting up of bee\\nhives at 15 units per ha may increase the cross-pollination in the garden. Further the additional\\nincome obtained through honey, increases the net profit per unit area.\\n(g) Hormone deficiency: The fertilized female flowers shed in some cases. By spraying 2–4 D at\\n30 ppm, the setting percentage could be increased to 32.5 per cent as against 25 per cent in the\\ncontrol. The chemical 2–4 D may be mixed at 30 mg per litre of water and sprayed one month\\nafter opening of the spathe using micro sprayer.\\n(h) Pests: Button shedding may happen due to the attack of bug. Spraying of systemic insecticides\\nlike Methyldemeton 0.025% or Dimethoate 0.03% may reduce the occurrence.\\nIPM for red palm weevil: The dead palm has to be disposed off and the stump burnt. The garden\\nshould be kept clean. Root feeding of Monocrotophos @ 10 ml + 10 ml of water/palm given with due\\nprecaution, viz., (i) Harvest and nuts before root feeding and subsequent harvests done 45 days after\\nroot feeding and ( ii) irrigation has to be given to root fed palms only after a week (or) Apply 1–2\\nAluminium phosphide tablets in the bore holes and plug it immediately with moist cement and Fytolan.\\n(i) Diseases: Button shedding also occurs due to disease incidence such as T hanjavur wilt. Adop-\\ntion of control measures suggested for the disease reduces not only spread of the disease but also\\nprevents shedding of buttons.'),\n",

In sandy soil, or ganic matter status of the soil has to be improved. For this, green manure\\ncrops may be raised and ploughed in situ or well-decomposed farm yard manure at 50 kg per palm has\\nto be applied every year. Only if organic manures are applied, the fungicides will be effective. Bordeaux\\nmixture (1%) drenching should not be done in summer months especially during March, April, and\\nMay. When Bordeaux mixture drenching and root feeding of Calixin or Aureofungin-sol + Copper\\nsulphate are done, the palms should be irrigated only after 4–5 days. For Bordeaux mixture drenching,\\nthe soil should be completely dry. Then only 40 litres solution will be required to drench at least\\n4–5\" depth of soil. Latest method of application for Aureofungin-sol is root feeding (2 g Aureofungin\\nsol + 1 g copper sulphate in 100 ml of water) and not stem injection. Neem cake (5 kg) also should be\\napplied to diseased trees every year. Neem cake application should not be combined with Bordeaux\\nmixture drenching.

The tobacco crop is grown for its leaves, which are used as a cured\\nproduct. India ranks third in the world tobacco production and second in flue cured tobacco exports.\\nThis crop occupies a pride of place with an export earnings of Rs. 1320 crores and excise revenue of\\nRs. 72470 crores anuually. T he crop offers significant emplo yment opportunities in rural India and\\nprovides livelihood to 36 million people annually in cultivation, curing, grading, factories and cottage\\nindustries, but also earns billions of dollars through trade and business. An industrial product of con-\\nsiderable importance is nicotine sulphate, which is prepared from tobacco for use as an insecticide and\\nfor the preparation of tobacco cessation products, drugs and the ameliorative effect on different dis-\\neases. At present, nearly 270 tonnes of 40% nicotine sulphate valued at Rs. 38 million are being\\nexported from India. Solanesol is a naturally occurring tri-sesquiterpene alcohol present in tobacco and\\nit is very in the pharmaceutical industry.\\nA. Origin\\nTobacco originated in the W estern hemisphere, and the types of tobacco presently being cultivated\\nevolved in Mexico and Central America. In India, tobacco was introduced during the early part of the\\n17th century by the Portuguese.'),\n",

Area and Distribution\\nIn tobacco production, India ranks third after China and Brazil and 5th largest exporter after Brazil,\\nChina, USA and Malwi. It accounts for about 10 per cent of the area and 8 per cent of production in\\nthe world. It is cultivated in 4 lakh ha of area and accounts for 0.27% of the total cultivable area in the\\ncountry. India’s production is 700 million kilograms. The principal tobacco growing states in the coun-\\ntry are Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, West Bengal, Bihar, Maharastra and\\nUttar Pradesh.\\nC. Classification\\nIndian tobaccos are classified into two species namely N. tobaccum  and N. rustica.\\nI. N. tobaccum:\\n\\x7f The plants of this species are usually taller attaining a height of 1.5–2.5 m.\\n\\x7f The leaves are larger but rather narrow.\\n\\x7f They may be sessile or petiolate.\\n\\x7f The colour of the flower is reddish, pinkish or white.\\n\\x7f It is used extensively for smoking and chewing purposes.\\n\\x7f It is used in manufacturing cigarettes, cigars, cheroots, bidi, chewing and snuff purpose.\\nII. N. rustica:\\n\\x7f The plants of this species are stocky, more bushy in nature and also shorter in height, usually not\\nmore than 0.9–1.2 m in height.\\n\\x7f The leaves are large and broad and ovate in shape and always possess a petiole.\\n\\x7f Flowers occur in cluster and are of dull greenish yellow colour.\\n\\x7f It is used extensively for hookah, chewing and snuff purposes.\\nD. Climate\\nAlthough tobacco is a tropical crop, it can be grown in a wide range of environments. In India, tobacco\\nis grown from 8°N latitude to 34°N latitude. Tobacco seeds require about 21°C temperature for germi-\\nnation. Temperature between 27°C and 32°C are desirable for rapid and unif orm germination.\\nE. Soil\\nQuality of tobacco is greatly influenced by the soil conditions. Tobacco is adopted to moderately acidic\\nsoils with a pH ranging from 5.5–6.5. Tobacco will not do well in water logged soils as it is sensitive\\nto water logging and impeded drainage.\\nF.

Field Preparation\\nA clean and well pulverized seed bed of good tilth is needed for transplanting tobacco seedlings. Land\\nshould be well prepared first and by deep ploughing with mould board plough followed by 3-4 cross\\nharrowings. Each harrowing should be followed by planking so that the soil is well pulverized and\\nlevelled. Care should be taken to see the weeds, stubbles etc are well removed from the field. Red sandy\\nloam soils are prefer red for nursery.\\nH. Seed and Sowing\\nTobacco seeds are very small and so are not sown directly in the field but are raised in a nursery.\\nTobacco seedlings are raised in specially pr epared raised seed beds (1.25 m width × 10 m length).\\nUsually, at least 6–8 weeks are required to obtain transplantable seedlings.\\nI. Raising Seedlings\\nApplication of FYM or compost at 12.5 kg + 80 g of super/2.5m 2 as a layer on the top of the beds is\\nfound to be highly beneficial in giving higher number of seedlings. The optim um time for sowing the\\nnursery is the second fortnight of August. A seed rate of 200–300 g per ha is quite sufficient. As the size\\nof the seed is very small, it should be mixed with sufficient quantity of sand and evenly distributed over\\nthe bed by sowing twice. Watering of nursery beds should be done carefully. The beds should always\\nbe kept moist but not wet. In the initial stages, on a sunny day 5–6 watering will be needed. Rose cane\\nis used for watering. Under favourable conditions,  germination starts from 5th day and completed\\n(5–12 days) by 12th day. If the seedlings are over–cr owded in some places, they can be thinned out,\\nwhen three weeks old. Normally, the seedlings will be ready for transplanting in 6–8 weeks time\\n(42–56 days).\\nJ. Transplanting and Manuring\\nThe field for transplanting tobacco seedlings should be well prepared. A few hours before transplanting,\\nnursery beds should be well watered to facilitate easy removal of seedlings without root damage.\\nFifteen cm height seedlings with 5–7 leaves are good for cigarette tobacco, but bidi tobacco requires\\nsmaller seedlings. Seedlings should be transplanted immediately after pulling. Transplanting should be\\ndone in the late afternoon to avoid heat injury. Optimum time of planting and spacing vary with the type\\nof Tobacco as given below:\\nFlue cured (black soil) : 80 × 60 cm\\nFlue cured (light soil) : 100 × 60 cm\\nCheroot : 60 × 45 cm\\nNatu (rain fed) : 90 × 90 cm.\\nTransplanting is usually done in the month of October–November in case of winter crop while at\\nthe end of March or in the beginning of April for the second or summer crop.

Water Management\\nWater requirement of tobacco crop depends upon the type of tobacco and the region where it is grown.\\nIn case of cigar and cheroot tobaccos, more frequent light irrigations are needed. In Tamil Nadu, about\\n20–22 irrigations at 48 hours intervals starting after seedling establishment for chewing and cigar filter\\ntobaccos are required. Up to 45 days, irrigation is given once in 3–4 days interval and at maturity stage,\\nit is given once in 4–5 days intervals.\\nL. Weed Control\\nIntercultural operations should start after 10–15 DA T, when the seedlings are well established. Orabanche,\\nwhich is a root parasite and is a menace to the tobacco crop is kept down by hand pulling. The only way\\nto control this weed is to collect and destroy it befor e seed formation. Trap cropping of green gram or\\ngingerly or sorghum reduces the infestation. One hand weeding at three weeks after transplanting (or)\\napplication of pre-emergence herbicide Fluchoralin at 1 lit/ha or oxyflourfen at 0.5 lit/ha one week\\nprior to planting is recommended.\\nM.  Topping\\nWhen flower heads begin to show, the plants are topped by removing off the top of the plant. Topping\\nmeans removal of the terminal bud. This pr actice stimulated the development of the remaining leaves.\\nIt is a very important operation for the quality of tobacco leaf. It gives an uniform quality product\\nleaving 10 leaves on the plant, besides 2 end leaves.\\nN. Desuckering\\nRemoval of these suckers is called desuckering. Manual removal of suckers by hand 4–5 times at\\nweekly intervals is done. The main aim of topping and de-suckering operations is to divert the energy\\nand nutrients of the plant from flower head to leaves, which influence the yield and quality of tobacco.\\nO. Harvesting\\nThe right stage for harvesting the crop is when the leaves are matured i.e., when the normal 1. green\\ncolour changes to yellowish green or slightly yellowish, 2. become thick, spotted and sticky to touch,\\n3. appearance of brown spots on the leaves, and 4. bulging of interveinal portions on the leaves. If such\\nleaves are bent under thumb, a cracking sound is produced. There are two methods of harvesting\\ntobacco.\\n(i) Priming: Harvesting is done by removing few leaves as and when they mature from bottom to\\ntop.'),\n",

Curing\\nCuring is a process by which harvested tobacco leaf is made ready for the mark et. There are four\\ncommon methods of curing.\\n1. Flue Curing: The harvested leaves are strung on sticks, which are then stacked in a flue curing\\nbarn. The barn is artificially heated . The curing process consists of 3 stages.\\n(i) Y ellowing: During yellowing, leaf is kept at a low temperature (32–35°C) and high humidity for\\nabout (30–40 hrs) till it attains a bright lemon yellow colour.\\n(ii) Fixing colour: After yellowing, the temperature is raised gradually and humidity of barn is\\nlowered by opening the ventilators with rapid rise in temperature when the leaf is still wet results\\nin a bluish-black discolouration called scalding. It takes about 16–24 hrs.\\n(iii) Drying: The ventilators are closed and temperature is again gradually raised to 160°F to dry the\\nveins and mid ribs of leaves. This takes about 28–42 hrs. Then, ventilators are opened to cool\\ndown the barn. The leaves are left in barn ov ernight for observing moisture to come to normal\\ncondition for handling and storage.\\n2. Air curing: The leaves are divided into gr oups according to their sizes and are strung on the\\nstring secured on a bamboo stick. These sticks are taken to barn with closed sides and roof. The leaves\\nare cured under atmospheric temperature and relative humidity of 70–80% is maintained by sprinkling\\nwater inside the barn. The entire process is over in about five to six weeks.\\n3. Fire curing: The leaves are harvested in such way that a small portion of stem remains attached\\nto the leaves. The leaves are wilted for a few hours in the field, then tied into bundles and hung in a\\nsmoke hut. They are smoked for about 12 hours by burning dried leaves of trees locally available. After\\nsmoke treatment, the leaf is fermented in bulks for about 3–4 weeks. The fermented leaves are given\\ntreatment with salt water or jaggery solution.\\n4. Suncuring: Sun curing is done in three ways.\\n(i) Curing whole plants on racks: After initial wilting in the field, the plants are strung on bamboo\\npoles and cured in sun. Entir e process takes about 15–20 days.\\n(ii) Curing leaves with pieces of stems or racks: Here, racks are not exposed to direct sun, therefore\\nit takes longer period (6–8 weeks).\\n(iii) Curing whole plant on the ground: Here, leaves are allowed to dry in sun on the ground and are\\nturned over twice a day. This process continues for about a week and then heaps are made which\\nare opened on the next day and reheaped. This process of heaping, opening the heaps, spreading\\nand reheaping is continued for about 10–15 days. By the end of this period, leaves becomes\\ncompletely cured.

It is also used for\\nmaking the reads, for mixing with other fibres and extraction of oil from cottonseed. Oil content ranges\\nfrom 15–25% depending upon the varieties. Cottonseed cake after oil extraction is a good organic\\nmanure and contains about 6% N, 3% P and 2% K. Cottonseed, cotton linters and pulp are good cattle\\nfeeds.\\nA. Origin\\nCotton has been used as a fibre in India from time immemorial. It has been cultivated for more than\\n5000 years in Indus valley. The cultivation of cotton spread from India to Egypt and then to Spain and\\nItaly. Every evidence shows that India is the origin.\\nB. Area and Distribution\\nIndia is the largest cotton growing country in the worl d. It ranks third in production next to China and\\nU.S (with a share of 12% at global production). In the world, Cotton is cultivated in 33 m.ha with a total\\nproduction 42 m. t. of seed cotton. Important cotton growing countries are India, USA, Russia, China,\\nBrazil, Egypt, Pakistan, Turkey, Mexico and Sudan. These countries nearly account for 85% of total\\ncotton production. Cotton is cultivated in India from sub-Himalayan region of Punjab in north to Kerala\\nin south and from dry regions of Kutc h to high rainfall areas of Manipur in east. Among the cotton\\ngrowing countries, India occupies the foremost position in area and the area under cotton is 8.5–9.0\\nm.ha (more than 65% of cotton in rainfed). The productivity is 462 kg lint/ha during 2004–05. Produc-\\ntion is 24.3 million bales. The world average productivity is 642 kg lint/ha. The Indian area accounts\\n25% of the world cotton acreage , but production is only 9% of the total world seed cotton output.\\nGujarat is the largest producer of cotton followed by Punjab, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka,\\nAndhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.\\nC. Classification\\nCotton belongs to the Malvaceae family and the genus Gossypium. According to Hutchison (1947), the\\nfollowing four cultivated species are popular in India.\\nGossypium arboreum   ( n = 13)\\nGossypium herbaceum (n = 13) Desi cotton.\\nGossypium hirsutum    ( n = 26)\\nGossypium barbadense (n = 26) American cotton\\nG. Arboreum: Plant height is 1.5–2 m, leaves have seven lobes, leaves and twigs are pubescent,\\nfibres are coarse and short with 1.25–2.10 cm length. It covers 29% of cotton area in the country.\\nG. Herbaceum: Plant height is 1–1.5 m. Leaves and twigs sparsely hairy. Leaves have 3–6 lobes.\\nFibre length is 1.25–2.30 cm. It covers 21% of the cotton area.\\nG. hirsutum: It is commonly called as “American cotton” and plants are 1.5 m tall. Leaves and\\ntwigs are densely hairy. Leaves have 3–5 lobes. Fibre length is 1.8–3.1 cm. It covers about 50% of the\\ncotton area.\\nG. Barbadense: It is commonly called as ‘Sea Island Cottons”. Plants are about 2.5 m tall. Leaves\\nare deeply lobed with 3–5 lobes and fibre length is 3. 6–5.0 cm. Lint is readily detachable from the\\nseeds. Area is only few thousand ha.\\nD. Climate\\nCotton is a warm season crop. A daily minimum 16°C required for germination and 21–27°C for proper'),\n",

The fibre is some times referred to as Deccan hemp\\nor Ambari hemp. The leaves, tops and tender branches are greatly esteemed as a cattle fodder and\\nbelieved to be especially valuable for cows and buffaloes milk. The leaves and tender shoots and young\\nfruits are also eaten by people , cooked like ordinar y pot herbs or in chutneys and curries.\\nDuring 2003–04, it occupies an area of about 0.20 million ha with an annual production of about\\n1.08 million bale (one bale = 181 kg fibre). The productivity of mesta is 11 q/ha. The potential yield\\nof jute is 35–40 q/ha but the actual realization is a little more than 50% of potential yield.\\nMesta cannot tolerate salinity as well as acidity. It is grown as a rainfed crop in black cotton soil.\\nThe varieties comprise broadly two viz., a green leaved one and a reddish leaved one in both of which\\nthe colour of the stem corresponds to the colour of the leaves. The red stemmed green veined variety\\nwas found to be the best for fibre. There is another species Hibiscus Sabdariffa, which has deep red\\nalmost dark flowers and capsules and which yield the fibre called Roselle. The fibre of mesta is rough\\nand strong with a breaking strength estimated to be 45.4 kg. The fibres are 3 m long, bright and glossy.\\nThough it resembles jute, it cannot stand water logging and is much used for making fishing nets, rough\\nsack cloth and canvas.\\nA.

Weeding\\nand pest and disease management may be need based.\\nF. Growth and Harvest\\nThe crop grows rapidly and begins to flower from the second month. The crop is harvested when about\\n50% or more plants are at flowering stage, as delay ed harvesting gives a higher fibre yield but the\\nquality becomes coarse and poor. The plants take 5½–6 months to become read y for cutting. At this\\nstage, the stem attains a thickness of 2\" in dia at the base about half that thickness along the upper\\nportions. The plants are cut at the base and brought over to the threshing floor where they are stacked.\\nAfter extracting the seeds, the stalks are taken to the retting tank or stream for preparing the fibre. The\\nstacks are tied into small bunds and kept submerged under water. They are kept in this way for 8 days.\\nThe bast is now quite loosened from the stem and can be easily peeled off in long strips and beating the\\nlong strips in water. The clean fibre is now dried in the sun and is put up in large plaits and stored.\\nG. Yield\\nWhen it is grown as a pure crop, the yield of marketable fibre may amount to 450 kg/acre as a\\nmaximum. As a mixed crop, the yield is 90 kg/acre. The out turn of fibre is about 16 per cent on the\\nweight of the dry stalks.\\n3. Agave (Agave Sp.)\\nAmong the under exploited resources, ‘Agave’–a fibre yielding drought tolerant plant is one which can\\nprosper the life of the dry land farmers without any risk . In India, it is cultivated in 50,000 ha. Agave\\nis a short-stemmed plant bearing a rosette of long erect pointed fleshy leaves. Agave is noted for its\\nstrong, coarse fibre, superior to and more flexible than Manila hemp. It is widely used for making ropes,\\ncordage, twine, fishing nets, door mats, land rugs and the short fibres are used for making mops,\\nbrushes. The waste material left after decorticating the leaves is used for making craft paper and\\npaperboards. The fibre also contains about 73–78% of lignified form of cellulose. Apart from these,\\nwax from agave wastes, Hecogenin acetate, a steroid useful for the pharmaceutical industry in India is\\nobtained from agave juice. The genus Agave has about 275 species, of which, A. sisalana, A.cantala\\nand A. americana commonly occur in India. Agave blossoms only once during its lifetime and then\\ndies. Agave plants are grown along railway line, roadsides, riverbanks and as a hedge plant in dry land\\nareas throughout the country. Till date, it is gro wn in patches and as border crop in a neglected condi-\\ntion. The crop comes up on dry soils unsuitable for cr op cultivation but grow vigorously on dry, well-\\ndrained sandy loam soils.\\nNursery: Agaves are usually propagated from bulbils or suckers. Grown up suckers can be dug out\\nand planted during rainy months. In case of bulbils, they are first sown in mother beds at close spacing\\n(5000 bulbils per bed of 1 × 20 m). After 6 months, the seedlings are pulled out and planted in the\\ntransplanting bed of size 20 × 1 m at 500 plants. In the second stage, it is kept for three months. After\\n9 months from the date of bulbils sowing, suc kers weighing ¼–½ kg and 9–12\" heights are ready for\\nplanting.\\nMain field planting: In the main field, they are planted at 2 × 2 m in pits of size 30 cm 3. Planting\\nis usually carried out during the rainy seasons for better establishment, otherwise, initial watering is\\nquite essential for establishment.\\nHarvesting: The leaves are ready for harvesting from 3rd year onwards. The older leaves of length\\nnot less than a metre is harvested in the 3rd year. Each plant yields 40–50 leaves/year. The life cycle of\\nthe plant is up to l8 years. The content of fibre varies with variety from 2.5%–4.5% and the highest is'),\n",

Agave sisalana produces a better quality fibre than Agave americana.\\nFrom 3rd year onwards, leaf yield of 30–40 t/acre could be harvested. Even as border crop, agave could\\nfetch revenue of not less than Rs. 2000/acre/year fr om 3rd year until 8th year.

Certain multipurpose bio-fuel plants can grow well in wastelands\\nwith very minimum input. Once cultivated, the crop has fifty years of life. Fruiting can take place in\\nthese plants in two years. Bio-fuel plants grown in parts of the waste land, for example, 11 m. ha, can\\nyield a revenue of appr oximately Rs. 20,000 crore a year and provide employment to over 12 million\\npeople both for plantation and running of the extraction plants. It will reduce the foreign exchange\\noutflow paid for importing crude oil, the cost of which is continuously rising in the international\\nmarket. The bio-fuel is carbon mono-oxide emission free. The oil can also be used for soap and in\\ncandle industries. De-oiled cake is a raw material for composting and the plantation is also good for\\nhoney production. One time investment needed for bio-fuel plantation to production in 11 m. ha will be\\napproximately Rs. 27,000 crores. The capital equipment and investment in plant and machinery can\\ncome from bank loans and private sector entrepreneurs. Bio-fuel plants can be grown in a number of\\nstates in the southern, western and central part of the country (Abdul Kalam, 2006).\\n1. JATROPHA CURCAS\\nJatropha curcas is multipurpose non-edible oil yielding perennial shrub originated in tropical America\\nand West Asia. It is commonly known as physic nut or purging nut. Jatropha curcas belongs to the\\nfamily Euphorbiaceae and has the tendency to produce latex and animals do not browse the plant. This\\nis a hardy and drought tolerant and this crop can be raised in marginal lands with lesser input. The crop\\ncan be maintained for 30 years economically. The genus Jatropha has 176 species and distributed\\nthroughout the world. Among them, 12 species are recorded in India. The species Jatropha curcas is a\\npromising one with economic seed yield and oil recovery. The oil from Jatropha curcas can be used as\\nbio-diesel blend upto 20%. However, the refined oil is a qualified neat bio-diesel. The plant flowers a\\nyear after planting and the economic yield is obtained from 4th year onwards. The farmers of southern\\ndistricts suggest that this crop can be cultivated as fence crop initially in black cotton soils of southern\\ndistricts under rain fed conditions.\\nClimate: It grows well under subtropical and tropical climates. It can tolerate extremes of tempera-\\nture but not the frost.\\nSoil: It is grown on wide range of soils. It comes up in the marginal lands and also in problem soils\\n(to some extent). For economic returns, soils w ith moderate fertility are preferred.\\nVariety: High yielding cultures collected from Tamil Nadu Agricultural University–TNMC–3, 4,\\n5, 7, 19 and 20.\\nPropagation: Jatropha is normally propagated through seeds. Well-developed plumpy seeds are\\nselected for sowing, seeds are soaked in cow dung solution for 12 hours and kept under the wet gunny\\nbags for 12 hours. Germinated seeds (2–3) are sown in poly-bags of 10 × 20 cm size filled with red soil,\\nsand and farmyard manure in the ratio of 1:1:1 respectively. In some areas, the seeds are treated with'),\n",

Sweet sorghum has emerged as a supple-\\nmentary crop to sugarcane in dry land pockets for the production of ethanol. The advantages of the crop\\nare: (i) it can be grown with limited water and minimal inputs; ( ii) it can be harvested in four months.\\nSweet sorghum is gaining the world attention as a promising bio-energy crop and alternative raw\\nmaterial for the production of alcohol. The success rate is high because of the use of existing machinery\\navailable in the sugar factories and attached distilleries. Sweet sorghum juice can be used for the\\nproduction of syrup called “sorghum honey”. Farmers, in a manner similar to jaggery preparation can\\nprepare sorghum honey. Bagasse can be enriched and sold as cattle-feed. It is also a highly suitable base\\nmaterial for cogeneration. Similarly, use of grain as an alternate raw material for the production of\\npotable alcohol is promising and receiving importance for use as biofuel.\\nSweet sorghum stalk is juicy and rich in fermentable sugars as high as 15–18 per cent and has\\npotential for cane yield of 40 t/ha or more. Projected uses of sweet sorghum are production of alcohol,\\nsyrup and jaggery from the stalk juice. The recovery of alcohol in  the pilot run showed 9 per cent of\\nthe juice having a brix of 12°. The various quality parameters that are determined along with the\\nphenotypic characters are juice yield (t/ha), juice extraction (%), juice br ix (%), juice pH, reducing\\nsugars (%), non-reducing sugars (Sucrose %), commercial cane sugar (CCS) equivalents (%), and total\\nsugars (%). These parameters play a very important role in determining the suitability of a genotype for\\na particular alternate use envisaged (mainly alcohol). So far no variety was released except SSV 84 (105\\ndays) through All India Coordinated Sorghum Improvement Project.\\nVarieties: The important sweet sorghum varieties released at international level are Rio, Dale,\\nBrandes, Theis, Rama, V ani, Ramada and Keller. BJ 248, RSSV 9, NSSV 208, NSSV 255 and RSSV\\n56 are the sweet sorghum cultures identified by the All India Coordinated sorghum Improvement\\nProject at National level. Hybrid Madhura developed by Nimkar Agricultural Research Institute, Phaltan,\\nMaharashtra is a popular hybrid in sweet sorghum. The TNAU has developed a sweet sorghum VMS\\n98003 with a cane yield of 45.7 t/ha and ethanol yield of 3.6 kl/ha as a promising sweet sorghum variety\\nfor Tamil Nadu and is being tested under adaptive research trial (ART) and will be released soon. Most\\nof these varieties mature in 100–110 days.\\nClimate and Soil: It can be sown during June, coinciding with the SWM, September-October\\nduring NEM with a rainfall of 500-600 mm well distributed across the growing period and also during\\nsummer with assured irrigation. The crop does not prefer high rainfall as high soil moisture or continuous\\nheavy rain after flowering may hamper sugar increase. If irrigation is available, sowing can be advanced\\nbefore June so that the crop does not face heavy rains after flowering and more so during the last half\\nof grain maturing period. Sowing during summer season may result in low biomass and sugar yield. All\\nsoils that have medium depth (18\" and above) with good drainage are suited. Depending on the soil\\n(red, black, laterite and loamy) and its depth, water requirement may vary which in turn decide the\\nsuitability of the crop.\\nSeed treatment: The seeds are treated with Carbendazim (or) Thiram @ 2 g/kg of seeds. The seeds\\nare treated with 2% KH 2PO4 for 6 hours as pre sowing treatment under rainfed condition. Before\\nsowing, the seeds are treated with azospirillum @ 600 gm/ha.\\nSeed rate and sowing: For better productivity, the optimum spacing should be 45 cm × 15 cm with\\na seed rate of 10 kg/ha. 3–4 seeds are dibbled in each hill/planting hole and the seedlings are to be\\neventually thinned to one per hill. If a planter is used, then the existing seed rate can be further reduced.\\nFertilization: Recommended dose of fertilizer for sweet sorghum in soils with normal fertility\\nlevel is 120 kg N, 40 kg P 2O5 and 40 kg K 2O. Half of N and whole of P and K are applied as basal.\\nRemaining N is to be top-dressed during 25–30 days after germination, following weeding and inter-\\ncultivation.'),\n",

The earthing up operation coincides with top\\ndressing of N fertilizer.\\nIrrigation: Sugar beet is very sensitive to water stagnation at all stages of its growth. Irrigation\\nshould be based on soil type and climatic conditions. Pre-sowing irrigation is essential at the time of\\nsowing. First irrigation is very crucial for the early establishment of the crop. For light textured sandy\\nloam soil, irrigation once in 5–7 days and for heavy textured clay loam soil, irrigation once in 8–10 days\\nis recommended.

Increased fertilizer use has been estimated to contribute to about one-fourth of the increased rice\\nproduction. In some countries, fertilizer prices were subsidised, thereby enabling farmers to apply produc-\\ntion-maximising doses. During the same period, use of organic manures including green manure, declined\\nsubstantially. But fossil fuel-based inorganic fertilizers are becoming more expensive. Another issue of\\ngreat concern is the sustainability of soil productivity as lands are intensively tilled to produce higher yields\\nfrom a single crop and higher total annual yields under intensive cropping system. The soil organic matter\\nand nitrogen levels vital to sustained crop production are often limiting in the soils of East, South and South-\\neast of Asia. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify alternate nitrogen sources to supplement inorganic\\nfertilizers. Occurrence of multi-nutrient deficiencies and overall decline in the productive capacity of soils\\nunder intensive fertilizers use has been widely reported. All these factors have created a renewed interest on\\norganic manures. Green manuring is a low cost but effective technology in minimising the investment cost\\nof fertilizers and in safeguarding the productive capacity of the soil. The practice of green manuring is as\\nold as the art of manuring crops. The first serious test was made in 1882 at Kanpur Agricultural Station in\\nUttar Pradesh and was followed at Nagpur and Damraon in 1882 and 1897 respectively. The European\\nplanters of India were the pioneers in giving a systematic practice of green manuring as far back as 1890\\nand the coffee estates of southern India. It is a well-known fact that N, for which soils have the greatest\\nhunger, is a costly plant nutrient. This can be cheaply obtained by the inclusion of leguminous crops in\\nrotations and their ploughing under.'),\n",

Definition\\nCrops grown for the purpose of restoring or incr easing the organic matter content in the soil are called\\ngreen manure crops. Their use in cropping system is called ‘Green Manuring’ where the crop is grown\\nin situ or brought from outside and incorporated.\\nGreen leaf manuring consists of gathering green biomass from nearby location and adding it to the\\nsoil. In both, the organic material should be worked into the soil while they are fairly young for easy\\nand rapid decomposition. Legumes are usually utilised as green manure crops as they fix atmospheric\\nnitrogen in the root nodules through symbiotic association with a bacterium, rhizobium and leave part\\nof it for utilization of the companion or succeeding crop.\\nB. Subsidiary Object of Green Manures\\n(a) Catch crops: Legumes are inter sown in the main standing crop a little before or after harvest.\\nWith a view to utilize the nitrates that might form during the off-season or the left over moisture in the\\nsoil profile. This may otherwise be lost. Such subsidiary crops are called ‘Catch Crops’. The catch crops\\nploughed in as green manures or grazed off. Utilizing the nitrates formed in the soil or residual moisture\\nis a primary object of Green Manuring is only incidental.\\n(b) Shade crops: Green manure crops may be sown in young orchards with the object of shading\\nthe soil surface and preventing the rise of tempera ture. Otherwise the tender roots of fruit plants may\\nbe affected by the high soil temperature. In planta tion crops like tea and coffee, Gliricidia is used as\\nshade crop first and then incorporated as green manure.\\n(c) Cover crops: Green manure crops are sometimes grown with the object of clothing the surface\\nwith a vegetative cover especially in hill slopes during the rainy weather to avoid soil erosion and\\nrunoff. This may also done to check wind erosion. The crop chosen should be capable of covering the\\nsurface at the time of commencement of rainy or windy season. Later it is used as Green manure.\\n(d) Forage crops: Some legumes are also grown for taking a few cuttings of green fodder for cattle\\nin every stages. For example , philippesara seeds are broadcasted in the standing rice crop (3–5 days\\nbefore harvest) in coastal Andhra Pradesh. The early growth supplies fodder for cattle and the later\\ngrowth is used for green manure purpose.\\nC. Advantages of Green Manuring\\nGreen manuring has a positive influence on the physical and chemical properties of the soil. It helps to\\nmaintain the organic matter status of arable soils. Green manure serves as a source of food and energy\\nfor the soil microbial population, which multiplies rapidly in the presence of easily decomposable\\norganic matter. The enhanced activities of soil organisms not only cause rapid decomposition of the\\ngreen manure but also result in the release of plant nutrients in available forms of use by the crops.\\nGreen manuring improves aeration in the rice soils by stimulating the activities of surface film of algae\\nand bacteria. Many green manure crops have additional use as sources of food, feed and fuel.\\n(i) Soil structure and tilth improvement: Green manuring builds up soil structure and improves\\ntilth. It promotes formation of crumps in hea vy soils leading to better aeration and drainage.\\nDepending on the amount humus formed, green manuring increases the water holding capacity\\nof light soils. Green manure crops form a canopy cover over the soil and reduce the soil tempera-\\nture and protect the soil from the erosive action of rain and water currents.\\n(ii) Fertility improvement of soils: Green manure crops absorb nutrients from the lower layer of\\nsoils and leave them in the soil surface layer when ploughed in, for use by the succeeding crops.\\nGreen manure crops prevent leac hing of nutrients to lower la yers.

Single\\ncrop of green manure on an average is reported to fix 60–100 kg nitrogen/ha in single season\\nunder favourable conditions.\\n(iii) Amelioration of soil problems: Green manuring helps to ameliorate soil problems. Sesbania\\naculeata (dhaincha), when applied to sodic soils continuously for four or five seasons, improves\\nthe permeability and helps to leach out the harmful sodic salts. The soil becomes fit for growing\\ncrops. Green leaf manure from sources such as Argemone mexicana and Tamarindus indica has\\na buffering effect when applied to sodic soils.\\n(iv) Improvement in crop yield and quality: Green manuring increases the yield of crops to an\\nextent of 15–20 per cent compared to no-green manuring.

Cassia pistula 1.60 120:1 0.24 1.20\\nOther green manures: There is an unexploited rich source of plants, which can be used as green\\nmanure in India. One such crop is velvet beans (Stizolobium deeringianum). This is an important forage\\nlegume widely grown in the tropics and sub-tropics. This crop puts up vigorous growth, accumulating\\ngreater biomass and covers the ground fairly well in a short period, smothering weeds and effectively\\nconserving soil moisture. Besides preventing soil erosion it also builds up soil fertility by adding\\norganic matter and fixing atmospheric nitrogen in the root nodules. It is drought tolerant, grows vigorously\\nand can thrive on diverse soil types and marginal lands and gives good yields even in less fertile soils.\\nThe leaves and vines form a good roughage. The pods and seeds have a high feeding value as a\\nconcentrate feed. The tender fruits and seeds from unripe pods can be used as vegetable. Studies\\nconducted at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore in two seasons, revealed that it could\\nproduce a high biomass yield of 28 t/ha at 60 days after sowing when sown at a closer spacing of\\n30 × 20 cm. When it is sown thickly it has a potential of producing 40–45 t of green matter. The crop\\naccumulated 255 kg N/ha at 60 days after sowing due to its vigorous growth and grater foraging for N\\nin the soil. One constraint limiting the greater use of this green manure crop is the non-availability of\\ngood quality seeds. V elvet beans were found to have a profuse pod bearing habit and gave a high yield\\nof 2 t/ha. Being a photosensitive crop it has to be sown at the right time to get optimum biomass and\\nseed yield. According to studies, V elvet beans accumulated greater biomass during South-west monsoon\\nand North-east monsoon. February was found to be the best month for sowing. Since it has multiple use,\\nits inclusion in the cropping system will open up new possibilities.\\nE. Choice of Green Manure Species\\nVarious nitrogen-fixing leguminous and non-leguminous species—particularly trees, creepers and\\nbushes—can be used as green manures.

Agronomy of Green Manure Crops\\n1. Sesbania speciosa (sithagathi): It is adaptive to different soil conditions and can come up in sandy,\\nloamy, alluvial, clayey and alkaline soils. Though the growth is very slow in the first 30–40 days, it\\npicks up subsequently making rapid growth. It withstands salinity to some extent. It has no serious pests\\nor diseases. The plant has greyish appearance with soft hairs on the stem and leaves. The stem is pithy,\\nbut if allowed to grow for more than four or five months, it becomes woody making it difficult to be\\npulled out or even to be harvested with sickle. There are different methods of growing Sesbania speciosa\\nin rice field. Three or five days prior to the harvest of rice crop, seeds at 50 kg/ha are sown as broadcast.\\nThese seeds get thrust into the soil while labourers move during harvest of rice crop. With the available\\nsoil moisture, the Sesbania seeds germinate. This method is very easy to follow as it involves no\\npreparatory cultivation for raising green ma nure crop. After ploughing the field, Sesbania seeds are\\nbroadcasted at 35–50 kg/ha. A good stand of crop can be obtained by irrigation. Where two crops of rice\\nare taken, three weeks old seedlings of Sesbania can be grown along the borders of the field during the\\nfirst crop season and utilised as green manure for the second crop. Such border planting of Sesbania at\\na spacing of 5–10 cm in one hectare will give about 5000–8000 kg of green matter for the second crop.\\nFor this purpose, at the time of raising rice nursery for the first crop, 0.75 kg of seeds of Sesbania may\\nbe sown in 2.5 cents of nursery. W hile transplanting rice seedlings, Sesbania seedlings are also pulled\\nout and planted along the borders of the field.\\nEach plant of Sesbania gives about 400–600 g of seeds. For sowing one hectare for green manure\\npurpose, 50 kg seeds will be necessary. Hence, if about 125–150 vigorous plants are left among the\\nborder plants, sufficient seeds could be obtained from these plants. The yield of green matter varies\\ndepending upon the duration of growth. A 60 days crop will yield about 10,000 kg/ha of green matter\\nwhile 90, 120, 150 days crop will yield 20,000, 50,000 and 60,000 kg/ha of green matter, respectively.\\nFor one hectare of rice crop, 6,250 kg of green matter will be sufficient.'),\n",

Sesbania rostrata (Manila agathi): It is a leguminous crop, which has nodules both on the stem\\nand roots. It was introduced in India during 1980’s from the International Rice Research Institute,\\nPhilippines. It is a tropical legume, which thrives well under flooded, and water logged conditions,\\nproducing aerial nodules on the stem. Due to its profuse stem nodulation, it gives ten times more\\nnodules than most of the legumes. This can be grown either prior to rice crop or in between two rice\\ncrops. Though naturally propagated by seeds,  seedlings and root stem cuttings can also be used as\\nplanting material. The normal seed rate is 30–40 kg/ha. To get early, uniform germination and vigorous\\nseedlings, seeds have to be scarified with concentrated sulphuric acid for 15 minutes. Summer\\n(April-July) is the best season for getting higher biomass and better seed production. The photosensitive\\nnature of this crop (short day) restricts its usage during winter. Inter cropping one row of 30 days old\\nseedlings for every 1.5 metre rice could produce 3–5 t of biomass in 30 days after transplanting. Rice\\nyields are not affected due to intercropping.'),\n",

Indigofera tinctoria: This is a perennial shrub. It is found wild and in cultivated lands. There are\\ntwo types, which closely resemble each other and are generally found grown as indigo (Madras Indigo\\nand Bengal Indigo). The seed rate is 25–30 kg/ha and the yield of green matter varies from\\n10,000–12,000 kg/ha.\\n7. Calapogonium mucunoides : This is a leguminous cover crop with the ability to cover the\\nground within a short period. It is also a self-sown crop. The cultivation of calopogonium as a cover\\ncrop is the cheapest and most effective method to check soil erosion and the growth of obnoxious weeds\\nin plantations of pepper, orange, coconut etc. It also enriches the soil and conserves soil moisture. It is\\nan annual/perennial, with creeping or climbing habit. It is not grazed by cattle. The plant is capable of\\ngrowing to a length of about 2.5 m in the course of about 16 weeks and to strike root at every one of\\nnearly 25 nodes over this length, though only about 50 per cent of these nodes actually develop roots\\nin the field. Each plant has three leader shoots and about eight main lateral shoots from each leader\\nshoot. In addition to the large volume of leafy growth over the ground, the plants are found to develop\\na large volume of roots in the ground. The luxurious surface growth of the plant protects the soil from\\nthe splash effects of raindrops during the monsoon months.\\nThe chief merit of Calopogonium as a cover crop, in addition to the ease with which it can be\\nestablished in a very short period, is that it dri es up during the summer months and offers no compe-\\ntition to the plantation crops for the limited soil moistur e. The leave shed by the cover crop during the\\nsummer months provide a dry mulch which could effectively reduce soil temperature and surface\\nevaporation during the season. Another desirable attribute of Calopogonium is that it re-establishes\\nitself during the rainy season and covers the soil within a short period. Profuse seeding is yet another\\nvirtue of calopogonium. This results in the cover crop establishing itself every year with the summer\\nshowers from the self-sown seeds. The seed rate f or establishing the cover crop in the beginning is\\n8–10 kg/ha and the yield of green matter is 5000 kg/ha.\\n8. Phaseolus trilobus (Pillipesara): This is a dual-purpose crop yielding good fodder for cattle and\\ngreen manure for land. It is an herbaceous creeper growing into a short dense cover crop when grown\\nthick. Though it does not produce a bulky yield, it is capable of being cut twice or thrice before being\\nploughed into the field. The harvested material is used as forage. Seeds are also used as a minor pulse.\\nIt comes up under varying conditions of soil but prefers loamy and clayey soils. Initially, adequate soil\\nmoisture is essential for its early growth. One or two irrigations given during its growth period will help\\nin producing bumper harvest of forage crop. After this harvest, the crop can be ploughed into the soil.\\nIt is able to withstand drought and also excessive soil moisture. The seed rate is 20–25 kg/ha and the\\nyield of green matter is 10,000–12,000 kg/ha.'),\n",

Agronomy of Green Leaf Manure Shrubs and Trees\\nGreen leaf manuring is the application of green leaves gathered from shrubs and trees growing in waste\\nlands to the fields where crops are to be raised. Green leafy material is gathered from all sources by\\nfarmers for manuring purpose. Different kinds of shrubs growing on tank bunds, waste lands, field\\nbunds, garden lands, etc. are used. In addition, loppings from miscellaneous trees are also gathered for\\nuse as green leaf manure. Green leaves have the same effect as green manure on the land and the crop.\\nThe common shrubs growing in waste lands are Cassia auriculata, Dodonia viscosa, Calotropis gigantea,\\netc. Leguminous trees like Pongamia glabra and can be planted in waste lands, for augmenting the\\nsupply of green leaves. The trees do not require any attention after they get established and start\\ngrowing. A brief description of some of the most common shrubs and trees utilised for the collection\\nof green leafy material is given below.\\n1. Glyricidia (Glyricidia maculata syn. G. sepium): It is a shrub type of plant that comes up well\\nin moist situations. Under favourable conditions of soil and climate, it takes up a tree habit. It is a quick\\ngrowing tree and often used for shade and green leaf manure in tea, coffee and cocoa plantations. It can be\\nplanted on alternate field bunds of wetland, 1–2 m apart, or as a thick hedge by close planting in 3–4 at\\n0.5 m spacing or along field border as tall shrubs giving support to the fence line or along farm roads on\\nboth sides for the production of green leaf. For green leaf purposes, the shrub could be kept low by pruning'),\n",

The shrub is pruned 2–3 times a year and it withstands repeated lopping.\\nIt has no root effect on the crops grown by the side. When the shrubs are regularly lopped, the height is\\nrestricted to 2–3 m and they do not affect the growth of cultivated crops with their shade effect.\\nGlyricidia can be propagated by planting stem cuttings or seedlings raised in nurseries. The\\nestablishment of seedling is better compared to stem cutting. T he seeds are sown in well prepared\\nnursery and the seedlings transplanted when they are about 30–60 days old. W ithin two years after\\nplanting, the plants are ready for lopping. Each plant gives 5–10 kg of green leaves annually. When the\\nindividual rice fields are about 0.1 ha each, 375–400 plants can be planted on the bunds of one hectare\\nof land and this will produce 2500-3500 kg of green leaves annually.\\n2.

Thespesia populnea: It is also an ever-green tree, whic h thrives in all types of soils. The trees\\nare grown in garden land areas, gardens and also in waste lands. A spacing of 4–5 m is adopted. It is\\npropagated by stem cuttings. It establishes very quickly and produces a n umber of branches. Two or\\nthree lopping of green leaves are taken in a year during favourable seasons. A tree will give as much\\nas 100–150 kg of green matter per lopping.\\n7. Delonix elata (Vadanarayan): It is a tropical ever green tree, which thrives in all types of soils.\\nGenerally, it is propagated by stem cuttings. In a year, 2–3 lopping can be taken during favourable\\nseasons. It has some medicinal values.\\nI. Rhizobial Inoculation\\nThe leguminous green manure crops have the a bility to fix gaseous nitrogen from the air with the aid\\nof rhizobia, which live in nodules on the roots of the legume plants. The bacteria live symbiotically in\\nnodules, with the plants providing food and energy for the organisms, w hich, in turn, benefit the host\\nplant by fixing nitrogen from the air. Consequent on this symbiotic relationship the leguminous plants\\nsucceed in enriching the soil nitrogen status only in the presence of proper nodule bacteria.

Without Rhizobium bacteria, the leguminous green manure\\ncrops may deplete the soil of nitrogen like any other non-leguminous plants instead of replenishing the\\nsoil nitrogen store. Among the root nodule bacteria (rhizobia), there are several types and strains, which\\nare specific for different legumes. For best results, appropriate str ains of Rhizobium bacteria for each\\nlegume should be present. It may be that poor and inef fective forms of many of the strains of rhizobia\\nare present in normal soils. They may produce nodu les that provide little or no nitrogen. Therefore, it\\nbecomes necessary to inoculate the legume seeds with beneficial strains of proper root nodule bacteria.\\nThe process of nitrogen fixation begins as soon as or shortly after the formation of nodules, and\\ncontinues as long as the nodules remain firm and healthy. The maximum nitrogen fixation is found to\\ntake place at the flowering stage of the host plant.

Stage of Incorporation\\nWhen the green manure crops are grown and incorporated in the same field, the best stage of incorporation\\nis the flowering stage of the crop. However, when green-leaf manuring is practised by bringing in the\\ngreen plants grown elsewhere, no definite stage can be fixed as the green leaf manuring is controlled\\nby many other factors. But it can be said that the plants used for green leaf manuring should be\\nincorporated into the soil before they mature or attain the woody nature. Plants of very young nature\\nalso should not be incorporated as they will very  easily decompose leaving little residue in the soil.\\nWoody plants will decompose very slowly. Hence, the best stage for incorporation of plants is either at\\nthe flowering stage or before they attain the woody texture.\\nK. Time of Incorporation\\nThe success of green manuring depends on the correct time of trampling green matter into the soil and\\ngiving sufficient interval before sowing or planting the crop. The manure, being a bulky one is usually\\napplied as basal dressing before the main crop is raised in the field. In our country, except for some\\nperennial crops like coconut, fruits and some plantation crops like tea and coffee, green manure is\\napplied as basal dressing. After incorporation, sufficient time is allowed for decomposition to take place\\nand only after this, the main crop is sown or planted. However, the time will vary according to the crop\\nand other agronomic practices followed. For example, for sugarcane, sunnhemp is grown along with the\\nmain sugarcane crop and the green manure crop is incorporated after about 40 to 50 days growth at the\\ntime of earthing up. In the case of plantation crops, gr een manure grown in the same field or brought\\nfrom outside is incorporated for the decomposition in the field. Usually about six to eight weeks time\\nis found to be sufficient for the decomposition.\\nL. Method of Application of Green Manure\\nThe method of application varies from place to place depending upon other agronomic practices followed.\\nIn the case of green manuring, when plants are grown in the same field where they are to be incorporated,\\nthe plants are cut at the proper stage to the ground level, placed in the furrows and covered by the next\\nfurrow. With the availability of labour saving implements like green manure trampler, the plants are\\ntrampled by working the implement and later on levelling the field. This practice is possible where rice\\nis transplanted. In broadcast crop, a suitable modification is necessary and usually both green manure\\ncrops is incorporated during the first weeding. In case of green leaf manuring, the plants brought from\\noutside source are spread over the field and trampled in by the use of implements or by human labour.\\nIn some cases, as in the green manuring of sugarcane, the incorporation is done during inter cultivation\\noperation.\\nM. Decomposition of Green Manures\\nThe green manure applied to soil undergoes a series of chemical changes and only after these biochemi-\\ncal changes the nutrients contained in the plants become available and the Humus is synthesized.\\nHence, as in the case of any other bulky organic manure, the nutrients become available slowly and\\nsteadily for a prolonged period of time. The green matter applied to the soil is acted upon by many types\\nof micro organisms such as bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes and macro organisms like protozoa, worms\\nand insect larvae and several end products and inter mediate products are formed during the decompo-\\nsition. The type of decomposition and the products formed are found to be controlled by the following\\nimportant factors:\\nOrganisms present: The type and nature of micro organisms whether fungi or bacteria, aerobic or\\nanaerobic, autotrophic or heterotrophic or ganisms, will decide the type of decomposition.'),\n",

Hence, there is aerobic decomposition in the presence of air and anaerobic decomposition in the\\nabsence of air.\\nMoisture supply: The moisture content of the green matter and the soil decide the rate and type of\\ndecomposition. Optimum moisture is necessary for the nor mal rate of decomposition. In low moisture\\nsupply, decomposition will be slowed down.\\nSoil factors: The various physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil will influence the\\nrate and type of decomposition. In general, the decomposition will be rapid in a fertile soil than in a\\nnon-fertile soil.\\nNature of green manure : The composition of the green manure, its age, maturity, etc. will also\\ninfluence the rate and type of decomposition. The young plants will decompose more rapidly than well-\\nmatured plants. Similarly plants having greater amount of nitrogen will decompose more rapidly than\\nthose having higher content of carbon compounds. Putting all the above influencing factors together,\\nthe decomposition can be broadly studied under two categories viz., aerobic decomposition and anaero-\\nbic decomposition or purification\\n(i) Aerobic decomposition: The plant material incorporated into the soil is made up of numerous\\ncompounds. But, for studying the decomposition pr ocesses the various compounds can be roughly\\nbrought under three groups: (1) Carbon compounds consisting of carbohydrates, fats, oils, organic\\nacids, lignin and other cyclic organic compounds; (2) Nitrogen compounds consisting of proteins,\\namino acids and other non-protein nitrogenous substances, and (3) Mineral salts. In this process of\\ndecomposition, the most important deciding factor is the aeration in the soil and sufficient quantity of\\nair is always necessary for the normal rate of aerobic decomposition.\\nChanges in the carbon compounds: The various carbon compounds are attacked by the organisms\\nand all of them are found to be converted finall y to carbon dioxide and water. For example, if glucose\\nis attacked by the aerobic bacteria, carbon dioxide and water are produced.\\nC6H12O6 + 6  O2 BACTERIA → 6 CO2 + 6 H 2O + ENERGY\\nIn the same way, if starch, cellulose, and hemicellulose are present, they will be converted finally\\nto carbon dioxide and water. This conversion is found to be performed by a group of bacteria, fungi and\\nactinomycetes capable of living only under aerated condition. But the various organisms capable of\\ndecomposing the carbonaceous material r equire sufficient quantity of energy and nutrients. They find\\nsufficient energy from the decomposition of carbohydrates but there may be insufficiency of nitrogen\\nand phosphorus and in such cases, nitrogen and phosphorus should be added to favour all the activities\\nof the organisms. In the case of young plants there may be sufficient quantities of nutrients and hence\\nthe rate of decomposition of carbonaceous material will be carbon dioxide and water but this conver-\\nsion is not so quick and simple as seen from the reaction.\\nChanges in nitrogen compounds: Proteins constitute the major nitrogenous compounds in the\\nplant material. When protein undergoes decomposition, it is first hydrolysed by proteolytic enzymes\\nproduced by micro organisms to polypeptides, amino acids and other nitrogen derivatives. These are\\nfurther acted upon and ammonia is formed. The ammonia produced does not accumulate in the soil\\nexcept under anaerobic condition, but under aerobic nature, it is rapidly oxidized by the nitrifying\\nbacteria to nitrate. Some of the ammonia may also be consumed by the micro organisms. In addition\\nto the protein the other nitrogenous compounds like urea,  purine bases, lecithin, choline, cyanamide,\\nalkaloids etc., are decomposed by a great variety of micro organisms.'),\n",

Humus is nothing but the ligno-protein complex formed by\\nthe combination of the microbial protein and the lignin present in plants. Lignin is resistant to microbial\\ndecomposition and in the presence of microbial protein present in the body of the micro organisms they\\nunite together forming the more persistent material called humus. This is the type of decomposition\\ntaking place when green manure is applied to aerated soils (garden lands and dry lands).\\n(ii) Anaerobic decomposition- This is found to take place in soils, w hich are poorly aerated, or\\nunder waterlogged conditions. Under these circumstances only the organisms capable of thriving in the\\nabsence of oxygen will develop and they will decompose the various constituents present in the plant\\nbody.\\n(a) Changes to carbon compounds: The various compounds are attacked and converted to methane,\\nvarious organic acids, alcohols and carbon dioxide. For example, if glucose is attacked by\\nanaerobic bacteria and fungi, lactic acid, alcohol, butyric acid and fumaric acid are produced.\\nC6H12O6 BACTERIA ⎯⎯ → 2C3H6O3 (Lactic acid)\\nC6H12O6 BACTERIA ⎯⎯ → 2C2H5OH (Ethyl Alcohol)+2 CO2\\n      C 6H12O6 FUNGI ⎯⎯ → C3H6O3 + C2H5OH + CO2\\n                2C 2H5OH ⎯⎯ → C2H4O + 2 CH 4\\nHence, all the non-nitrogenous compounds are finally found to be converted to the above men-\\ntioned products.\\n(b) Changes in the nitrogenous compounds : Here also the proteins, on hydrolysis by the various\\nhydrolytic enzymes produced by the various micro-or ganisms are converted to polypeptides,'),\n",

The number obtained by\\ndividing the percentage of organic carbon by the percentage of nitrogen is usually referred to as carbon-\\nnitrogen (C:N) ratio. Carbon-nitrogen ratio is of fundamental and practical importance in understanding\\nthe mineralization of the organic matter. It is a well established fact that the C: N ratio exerts a marked\\ninfluence upon the mineralization of carbon or nitrog en of the green matter, both under aerobic and\\nanaerobic conditions. Only green matter with C:N ratio of 30:1 or lower will decompose in the normal\\nmanner. Materials with a very wide ratio do not decompose rapidly as the nitrogen contained in the\\ngreen matter is not sufficient for the microbial activity and materials with very narrow ratio decompose\\nmore rapidly as excess nitrogen is available for the microbial activity. This is due to the fact that the\\nvarious micro organisms taking part in the decomposition process require carbon for their energy and\\nnitrogen for the synthesis of their protoplasm. Hence, in the presence of more carbon (wide C:N ratio)\\nmore energy giving material will be available for the micro organisms and thus the increased activity\\nof the organisms will utilize all the nitrogen. Once the available nitrogen is exhausted, the micro\\norganisms will become inactive and decomposition rate will be retarded. In contrast, when proportionate\\namounts of both carbon and nitrogen are available, the mineralization will proceed in a normal way.\\nMature plants have a very wide C:N ratio of 50:1. In such cases, the carbon, when mineralized,\\ngives out energy, which is utilized by the various micro organisms. With the availability of more energy,'),\n",

Thus the entire\\nnitrogen will be left to be mineralized and thus the wide ratio in the beginning will be narrowed down\\nand when this type of green matter is added to the soil, it will be acted only by the carbon mineralizing\\norganisms. When green matter with very narrow ratio, below 20:1, is applied to the soils, the availability\\nof nitrogen will be more due to more mineralization of nitrogen. However, in all cases of plant materials,\\nfinally the C:N ratio will be brought to about 10:1, which is said to be an equilibrium stage. Succulent\\nand leafy portions of green manure, when applied, decompose very quickly (in about a week time), and\\nbehave almost like inorganic fertilizer. In contrast, when matured and woody plants are used, much time\\nis taken for the decomposition, and the nutrients are released very slowly as in the case of other bulky\\norganic manures. Thus, the C:N ratio is an useful indicator by which the decomposition process, the\\nrelease of nutrients and other biochemical reactions connected with mineralization can be well understood.\\nN. Farmer Acceptance of Green Manuring\\nIf green manure crops are not associa ted with a direct increase in income, fa rmers are not likely to be\\ninterested in them. It is, therefore, important that green manuring raises the fa rmer’s income not only\\nindirectly by improving soil fertility but also directly,(e.g., by yielding by-products of economic impor-\\ntance such as fuel, stakes for climbing plants, food, fodder and local medicines). All forms of sown\\nfallow demand a great deal of labour. Even more important can be the point in time when this labour\\nis needed. If this coincides with other farm activities that cannot be delayed and improved fallow is not\\nlikely to be accepted by the farmers. Where forms of alley cropping are practised, farmers often prefer\\nto plant the green manure crops in a looser configuration than the recommended model. Two legumi-\\nnous plants, which show great promise as green manure, are velvet bean ( Mucuna pruriens ) and\\nsunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea, C.ochroleuca).\\nO. Limitations in Raising Green Manure Crops\\nThough there are several advantages of green manuring, it is not being practised on a large scale by the\\nfarmers due to certain limitations.\\n\\x7f Non-availability of water resources may restrict raising of green manure crops.\\n\\x7f Non-availability of good quality seeds poses a problem.\\n\\x7f Allotment of 6–8 weeks exclusively for growing a green manure crop is not preferred by farmers\\nin intensive cropping system.\\n\\x7f In North India, where rice is gro wn after a wheat crop, the farmers are not able to carry out field\\noperations in the peak summer months of May and June.\\n\\x7f As the benefits of green manuring are not as spectacular as those usually derives from direct\\napplication of inorganic fertilisers, farmers are not convinced about the usefulness of green\\nmanuring.\\n\\x7f Sensitivity of certain leguminous green manure crops to photoperiodism is a constraint.\\n\\x7f V egetative growth is regarded by early flowering during a short,  dry season, resulting in less\\nbiomass production.\\n\\x7f A green manure crop may compete for time, labour and water, the cost of which must be\\nbalanced against the cost of inor ganic fertilisers.\\n\\x7f Poor germination of certain green manure seeds is also a problem.\\n\\x7f Incorporation of green manure crops under certain situations may be difficult and costly.'),\n",

Acacia sp. (Velvel, Karuvel) Acacia nilotica\\nIn English, it is called as Indian gum Arabic tree and in Tamil,  it is known as Karu velam. In Hindi, it\\nis called as Babul. It belongs to Mimosae family.\\nUtilization: Leaves and pods are widely used as fodder. It is an extremely valuable source of fuel\\nwood and charcoal of excellent quality. General utility of timbers is for construction of carts, wheels,\\nagricultural tools and implements, doors, windows, mine props, fencing materials etc. Bark is one of the\\nbest tanning materials of Northern India. Babul gum is used in inks, paints, matches and confectionery.\\nDistribution: Babul is indigenous to the Western part of the India–Gangetic plains and the Northern\\npart of Deccan plateau, including Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Gujarat. It is widely\\nplanted, or self-sown throughout the hot regions of lndia, viz., Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya\\nPradesh and Karnataka. It is an important constituent of souther n dry mixed deciduous tropical forests\\nand Northern and Southern tropical thorn forests of India; at an elevation range of 200–500 m.

Hence, pastures may be of two types viz., 1. natural pastures, and 2. seeded pastures. Native\\npastures are highly degraded ones. The improvement and management involves a set of technical and\\nsocial interventions. The important technical interventions are:\\n(i) Identification and introduction of suitable grass and legume species: Suitable pasture species for\\ndrought prone areas are given below:\\nPasture species Soil type Seed rate Dry forage\\n(kg/ha) yield (t/ha)\\nSewan grass Light soil 3–5 3.5 t/ha\\n(Lasiurus sindicus)\\nMarvel grass Medium to 4–5 2.5 t/ha\\n(Dicanthium annulatum) heavy soil\\nBuffel grass Vertisols 5–6 4.0 t/ha\\n(Cenchrus ciliaris)\\nDinanath grass Vertisols–All 8–9 3.0 t/ha\\n(Pennisetum pedicellatum) types\\nPerennial legumes\\nStylo. Stylosanthus hamata Light to 5–7 3.5 t/ha\\nS. scabra Medium soil 4–6 2.5 t/ha\\nSiratro:\\nMacroptilium atropurpureus Light to 7–8 2.8 t/ha\\nMedium soil\\n(ii) Improved moisture conservation: Forming contour furrows (60 cm wide and 22 cm deep) at\\na distance of 8–10 m across the slope of the grassland increase forage production of perennial\\ngrass by 130% over non furrowed grass lands.\\n(iii) Using suitable establishment techniques:\\n(a) Reseeding: Due to poor ger mination of seeds of Sewan and Marvel grass, the sowing of\\nmixture of seeds of Cenchrus species and Sewan grass is found advantage for large scale\\ndevelopment of pasture in arid regions like Rajasthan.\\n(b) Transplanting: The establishment of Sewan grass and Marvel grass is found more assured\\nby transplanting of rooted slips, or seedlings compared to direct seeding.\\n(c) Dry seeding: Cenchrus ciliaris seeds sown in dry soil before on set of rain give 36% higher\\nforage yield ov er monsoon sowing.\\n(d) Pelleting forage seeds for higher seed germinations: Pellets are prepared by mixing grass\\nseeds with cow dung, clay and sand in proportions of 1:1:3:1 using sufficient quantity of\\nwater for preparing round pellets  of size of about 0.5 cm diameter.'),\n",

Application of 20 kg N to Cenchrus pastures results in 83% increase\\nin dry forage yield. In well rainfall distrib uted area, application of NPK at 40:20:0 is recom-\\nmended. For stylo, application of “ P” at 30 kg/ha is recommended. The protein content of\\nfertilized pastures was higher than that of unfertilized ones.\\n(v) Regulating the grazing pressure and using an optimum stocking rate: The access of live-\\nstock to pastures should be controlled, so that grazing pressure could be managed.\\nCarrying Capacity: The native pasture can carry only 2 sheep/ha. But improved pasture can carry\\nup to 6 sheep/ha in a continuous grazing system. The quality of pasture can be evaluated in terms of\\nnumber of lambing and lamb weight at birth. The improved pastures produced more number of lambs\\n(2.78) than natural pastures (1.56), because of better quality of forages.\\n(vi) Rotational grazing: It is one in which the pastureland is divided into number of compartments.\\nThe sheeps are allowed to graze first in one compartment. After completion of grazing in the first\\ncompartment, the sheeps are allowed to graze in the second compartment and then in third\\ncompartment. T his is recommended for the grassland having annual grass species. But this\\nsystem requires additional investments. T his system has several advantages.\\n\\x7f There is no wastage compared to continuous grazing.\\n\\x7f The pastures get enough regrowth periods.\\n(vii) Increasing the grazing period through introduction of top feed tree species: A major short-\\ncoming of most of common pastures is lack of production during hot summer lean period. A\\ntraditional way to over come this is to use tree leaf fodder during this period. In the pasturelands,\\nlot of trees is growing.

Steps for making hay\\n\\x7f Good quality hay is prepared by adopting the following procedure:\\n\\x7f Quality of hay mainly depends on the stage of harvest: The fodder crops namely cowpea, velvet\\nbean, guar, moth bean, jowar, bajra, teosinte and oats should be cut at flowering stage for hay\\nmaking.\\n\\x7f Pasture and cultivated grasses are cut at 50% flowering or slightly earlier to prevent the\\nlignifications of cellulose, losses of protein and palatability.\\n\\x7f Lucerne and Berseem are cut for hay making at 30–40 days interval.\\n\\x7f The fodder crop should not be harvested immediately after irrigation. They should be harvested\\nin the afternoon and before irrigation.\\n\\x7f Though the fodder species may be dried as suc h in the field itself, the best quality hay is made\\nby chaffing into small pieces by hand driven machine or with a power drivers chaff. Either\\nchaffed or unchaffed material is spread evenly in layers and is turned 2–3 times daily. In the\\nevening, half dried material is racked and collected or heaped in the form of cone so as to\\nprevent exposure of the material to dew fall at  night. On the second day, the material is again\\nspread evenly after the dew has disappeared. The material is turned frequently depending on the\\nclimatic conditions. During summer, the hay of lucerne, cowpea, berseem etc., may preferably\\nbe made in shade so that bleaching action may be reduced to the minimum.\\n\\x7f The hay made by adopting above steps and possessing about 15% moisture is finally transported\\nto the hay-barn. It should retain green colour, good aroma and flavour.\\n\\x7f It should be preferably stored at low temperature and humidity so as to prevent the losses owing\\nto oxidations of carbohydrates. For rainy season s, hay curing sheds are recommended.\\n\\x7f In order to minimize the space for storage and for effective long term storage, the hay is turned\\ninto bales of suitable sizes with manually operated or power driven hay-bales.\\nB. Losses of fodder quality\\n\\x7f Shattering of leaves (mostly in legumes)\\n\\x7f Fermentation—Normal loss is about 6% of dry matter\\n\\x7f Oxidation leads to loss of carotenes\\n\\x7f Leaching—Loss of protein, N free extract minerals and vitamins. Thereby crude protein content\\nincreases and digestibility decreases.\\nC. Methods of haymaking\\n(i) Hay curing structures: In some countries, haymaking is done in hay barns, which are specially\\ndesigned structures in which hot air is cir culated for drying the mater ial quickly. However, in\\nIndia, the most prevalent systems are as follows:\\n(ii) Fence method: In this method, fodders are cut and spread evenly and thinly over the fences of\\nthe paddocks or fields or specially erected fences. This method helps to dry the material quickly\\nand turning of the material after every 2 or 3 hours daily can be avoided.\\n(iii) Tripod method: In this system, tripods of convenient heights are erected by using local materials\\ne.g., wood or galvanized iron poles. In between these poles, horizontal supports are erected to\\nincrease the carrying capacity. Unchapped fodders are dried in the manner described under the\\nfence method.\\n(iv) Gable shaped structure: The gable shaped structures is made by using galvanized woven-wire\\nfencing material of desired width and angle iron poles. The fencing material is fixed in such a\\nway as to provide a slopping support and good ventilation for quick drying. This system also'),\n",

The structure can be made economical further by using netted ropes of medium diameter\\nand wooden poles.\\n(v) Hay curing shades: Hay curing shades of convenient size of 18 m × 9 m × 3 m with a slanting\\nrod supported by pillars are constructed with corrugated asbestos. Chain like fencing of\\n5 cm × 5 cm mesh and 1–1.2 m in width is arranged length wise in a 4 or 5 tier system. These\\ntypes of sheds are good for making ha y during the monsoon and summer.

T he material is turned 2 or 3 times daily till it dries\\ncompletely.\\n15.14.3 Silage Making\\nSilage is a product obtained by packing fresh fodder in a suitable container (Silo) and allowing it to\\nferment under anaerobic conditions with out undergoing much loss of nutrients. Fermentation under\\nanaerobic condition preserves the nutr itive value and enhances the keeping quality of the fodder. The\\nprocess of conserving the green fodder in this way is termed as ‘Ensiling’.\\nA. Qualities of good silage\\n\\x7f A good silage should be greenish or yellowish brown, with pleasant odour, possess high acid\\ncontent (pH ranges from 3.5–4.2).\\n\\x7f Silage having acidic taste and odour, being free from butyric acid, moulds with ammonical “N”\\n(less than 10% of the total nitrogen).\\nB. Crops suited for silage making\\nGenerally, the fodder crops rich in soluble carbohydrates and low to medium in protein content are\\nideally suited for silage making. High content of soluble carbohydrates provides excellent growth\\nmedium for the anaerobic bacteria to form abundant acids, which increases the keeping quality of the\\nsilage. Maize, Jowar, Bajra, Guinea grass, Para grass and Napier grass are highly suitable for making\\ngood quality silage. On the other hand, leguminous fodders, which normally have high moisture and\\nhigh crude protein and low soluble carbohydrates, are not considered fit for silage making.\\nC. Types of silos\\n(i) Tower silos: They are permanent type and are costly . They are constructed above the ground\\nlevel in the form of cylindrical towers. The diameter and height vary according to the needs. The\\nloss of dry matter in such silos is 5–10% only.\\n(ii) Bunker silos: These silos are constructed on the surface of the ground. They should always built\\non firm soils having good surface and subsurface drainage.\\n(iii) Pit or Trench silos: Pit silos are less costly than tower silos and are widely adopted for silage\\nmaking. Pits of desired sizes are dug according to the availability of green fodder. Pits silos are\\nnot suited to the areas where there is higher water table.\\nD. Making silage\\nA pit size of 20′ × 20′ × 20′ is sufficient for 50–55 t green fodder. The fodder crops should be harvested\\nand chaffed at proper stage of growth. The early harvesting of crops affects the production of different\\nacids. Thus the green fodder should have about 30–35% dry matter. In silo pits, the bottom and sides\\nshould be carpeted with dry grass or long straw of gr asses or cereal crops etc., so as to make 5–6 cm'),\n",

This carpeting helps to prevent the direct contact between fresh-chaffed material\\nand soil. The fodder to be ensiled should be chaffed in the small pieces (1–2 cm) by using the chaff\\ncutter. The silo pits must be filled very quickly (within 3–4 days) and the materials must be compacted\\nin such a way as to remove as much air as possible through constant pressing either by manual labourers\\nor bullocks or using tractor. The exclusion of air causes fermentation under anaerobic condition. The\\nlevel of chaffed material should be about 1–2 m above the ground level. During the course of fermentation,\\nthe material will gradually settle down. Urea at the rate of 3–4 kg per t of chaffed material is mixed with\\nor sprinkled evenly on different layers, if the chaffed material happens to be very low in protein content\\nin the case of cereal fodder. The silo pits after filling and compacting the material carefully, should be\\ngiven a doom–like shape for drainage of rainwater. Then thick layer of straw is put on the chaffed\\nmaterial from all sides and over the straw a thick layer of moist soil (10–12 cm) is spread. The surface\\nis covered either by mud plaster or polythene or alka thene sheets. This avoids contact of atmospheric\\n‘N’ with ensiled material, which prevent the anaer obic fermentation. The silage is ready after 2–3\\nmonths. A silo pit is opened and the material is removed daily by exposing little surface area to prevent\\nsunlight. The feeding of the silage should be regulated in such a way that the silage is used within a\\nreasonable period. Otherwise long exposure causes dr ying and deterioration in keeping quality. Silage\\nmay be fed in small quantities (4–5 kg per cow) to start with and later quantity may be increased to\\n15–20 kg. Under ideal condition, it can be stored easily for 1 year.\\nE. Advantages\\nIt is more suited in lean seasons when weather is not conducive for haymaking. Thick stemmed crops\\nlike sorghum and maize are better utilized. Weeds are used as fodder, consequently the weed seeds are\\ndestroyed. The final product is highly palatable and nutritious. Organic acids produced during ensiling\\nare similar to those organic acid produced in the digestive tract of the animals (ruminants) and used in\\nthe same manner (Lactic acid 3–13% and Butyric acid 0.2–0.5 %).\\nTERMINOLOGIES\\nAgrostology: A science, which deals with the study of grasses, their classification, management and\\nutilization.\\nForage crops: Crops, which are primarily grown for livestock feed for making hay or silage or utilized\\nas green fodder or grazed by animals.\\nFodder crops: Crops, which are harvested and used for stall-feeding.

A system consists of several components, which are closely related and interacting among\\nthemselves. In agriculture, management practices are usually formulated for individual crops. However,\\nfarmers are cultivating different crops in different seasons based on their adaptability to a particular\\nseason, domestic needs and profitability. Therefore,  production technology or management practices\\nshould be developed keeping in view all the crops grown in a year or more than one year if any\\nsequence or rotation extends beyond one year. Such a package of management practices for all the\\ncrops leads to efficient use of costly inputs, presides reduction in production cost. For instance, residual\\neffect of manures and fertilizers applied and nitrogen fixed by legumes can considerably bring down the\\nproduction cost if all the crops are considered than individual crops. In this context, cropping systems\\napproach is gaining importune.\\n16.1 CROPPING SYSTEM\\nIt is an important component of a farming system and it represents the cropping pattern used on a farm\\nand their interactions with farm resources other farm enterprises and available technology which deter-\\nmine their make up.\\nA. Cropping Pattern\\nCropping pattern means the proportion of area under various crops at a point of time in an unit area. If\\ncropping pattern indicates the yearly sequence and spatial arrangement of crops and fallow on a given\\narea.\\nB. Crop Rotation\\n(a) Meaning: Crop rotation refers to recurrent succession of crops on the same piece of land either in\\na year or over a long period of time. Component crops are so chosen so that soil health is not impaired\\nor Crop rotation refers to growing different crops in succession on a piece of land in a specific period\\nof time with an objective to get maximum profit from least investment without impairing the soil\\nfertility. This may also be defined as the repetiti ve cultivation of an ordered succession of crops (or\\ncrops and fallow) on the same land and one cycle may take one or more years to complete.'),\n",

This helps\\nin proper and uniform use of nutrients and water from the soil and the roots do not compete with\\neach other.\\n\\x7f Leguminous crops should be grown after non-leguminous crops because legumes fix atmos-\\npheric–N into the soil and add more organic matter to the soil. Actually, non-legumes are fertility\\ndepleting crops.\\n\\x7f More exhaustive crops should be followed by less exhaustive crops. For example, potato,\\nsugarcane, maize, etc need more inputs than oilseeds and pulses.\\n\\x7f Selection of the crops should be demand based. The cr ops, which are needed by the people of\\nthe area, can be easily sold at a higher price.\\n\\x7f Selection of crop should be problem based. For instance:\\n– On sloping lands which are prone to soil erosion, an alternate cropping of erosion-promot-\\ning crops e.g., millets and other row crops and erosion resisting crops, e.g., legumes should\\nbe adopted.\\n– Under dry land farming or partially irrigated areas, the selection of crops should be such,\\nwhich can tolerate the drought spell. Similarly in low lying and flood prone areas the crops\\nshould be such, which can tolerate water stagnation e.g., paddy, jute, etc.\\n– Selection of crops should suit the financial condition of the farmers.\\n– Crops selected should also suit the soil and climatic conditions.\\n\\x7f Crops of the same family should not be gro wn in succession because they act like alternate hosts\\nfor insects/pests and disease pathogens. Apart from this, different types of weeds are found\\nassociated with various crops, therefore, selection of the same type of crops in rotation encour-\\nages weed problems in the field.\\n\\x7f An ideal crop rotation is one, which provides maximum employment to the family and farm\\nlabourer. Some common crop rotations followed in various parts of the country are given below:\\nRotation Duration\\nPaddy–Wheat 1 Year\\nMaize–wheat 1 Year\\nMaize–potato 1 Year\\nSoybean–wheat 1 Year\\nMaize–potato–sugarcane 2 year\\nPaddy–sugarcane–wheat 2 year\\n(c) Advantages: The major advantages of following proper crop rotation principles are:\\n\\x7f Agricultural operations can be done timely for all the crops because of less competition.\\n\\x7f Soil fertility is maintained by legumes through fixing of atmospheric nitrogen encouraging\\nmicrobial activity and maintaining physicochemical properties of the soil. The soil is also pro-\\ntected from erosion, salinity and acidity.\\n\\x7f An ideal crop rotation helps in controlling insect pests and diseases. It also controls the weeds\\nin the fields.'),\n",

But this concept has got some limitations.\\n\\x7f The unit of classification is political and administrative. The scientific and natural features such\\nas soil and climate did not figure with greater emphasis.\\n\\x7f The cropping pattern was determined by the spread of crop expressed as percentage of the total\\narea of important crops. It is not necessary that spread and cropping efficiency will go together.\\n\\x7f Though the cropping pattern has been evolved after centuries of experience, in national perspec-\\ntive it is not necessarily the most efficient  use of land and other resources.\\n\\x7f No cropping pattern can hold good for all times. It has to change with the improvement in\\ntechnology and economic factors e.g., sugarcane and cotton average shrinks when the prices are\\nmore favourable for grain crops and vice-versa.\\nTherefore, a new concept has been evolved which refers to both time and space sequence of crops.\\nIt includes the identification of the most efficient crops of the region, which is considered a homoge-\\nneous soil and climatic belt, the rotation in which the crop best fits in, and the intensity of cropping. So\\nthe cropping pattern has been scientifically defined as yearly sequence and spatial arrangement of crops\\nor crops and fallow in a given area (Palaniappan, 1985). According to the new concept, the most\\nefficient crops will be identified in a homogeneous region and put in the yearly sequence (rotation)\\nwhere they fit best and the space (area) of those crops, which are inefficient, will be reduced and area\\nof efficient crops will be increased. This way, by knowing the temporal and spatial arrangement of\\ncrops in a region, we can identify the cropping pattern followed in the region.\\nFor the purpose of planning the cropping pattern, it is necessary to divide the country into\\nhomogeneous regions on some well-defined basis. There can be a number of physical, climatological\\nand agronomic criteria, e.g., climatic index and soil groups, as both are fixed entities and can be better\\ncriteria than the political units. It is necessary to know w hether crops grown are most suitable for the\\nregion; an analysis of productivity and efficiency of various crops in different regions becomes imperative.'),\n",

Multiple cropped lands can be broadly grouped into lowlands, irrigated\\nuplands, and rainfed uplands.\\nA. Lowland and Irrigated Uplands\\nRice based cropping systems predominate in lowlands. Number of crops per year and the crops that\\nfollow or precede rice depends on the period of water availability and the degree of control of water.\\nWhere irrigation or rainfall (> 200 mm per month) extends over 9–10 months, the system could be rice-\\nrice-rice, rice-rice-upland crop or upland crop-rice-r ice. When this period is limited to 6–8 months,\\nupland crop-rice-upland crop or upland crop may be appropriate. Early maturing rice cultivars are ideal\\nfor such sequences. If water is available for 4–5 months, only one rice crop is grown.\\nB. Irrigated Uplands\\nIn irrigated uplands where winter is mild, upland crops that can follow rice include legumes such as\\ngreen gram, black gram, soybean and groundnut, cereals such as maize, sorghum, pearl millet, finger\\nmillet and other crops such as cotton, sunflower and vegetables. Where the winter is cool, important\\ncrops, which can follow rice, are wheat, barley, mustard, chickpea and potato (Fig. 16.1). One irrigable\\nhigh rainfall uplands, sequential cropping with a wide range of crops is possible. The systems could be\\ncereal-cereal and cereal-legume, oilseeds or other cash crops. In northern India, potato or mustard can\\nbe added to maize-wheat by relay plating either of these in the standing maize and delaying wheat by\\nabout 2 months. Short duration green gram or fodder crops can be grown after the harvest of wheat in\\nsummer.\\nC. Rainfed Uplands\\nCropping systems in rainfed uplands predominantly take the form of intercropping in Alfishols, Inseptisols\\nand Entisols during rainy season. Cereal + pigeon pea system (sorghum + pigeon pea), cereal + cotton\\n(setaria + cotton) are popular in India. In Vertisols of high moisture retentivity, land is kept fallow\\nduring rainy season followed by sorghum, chickpea, sunflower or coriander on stored soil moisture\\nduring post rainy season (Fig. 16.2). However, double cropping can be practiced if the monsoon is\\nrelatively early. Under such conditions, sorghum, pearlmillet or a pulse crop can be taken during rainy\\nseason followed by sunflower, safflower, chickpea or coriander in post rainy season.\\nAgronomy of rainfed cropping systems\\nAgronomy of rainfed cropping systems includes all practices controlled by  the farmer that contribute\\nto productivity of crops. Many management decisions are influenced by climate, inherent soil proper-\\nties and socioeconomic constraints. Each decision on crop and cultivar, land preparation, fertilizers and\\nother agronomic practices will have impact on other factors as well. Intercropping is the major system\\nin rainfed agriculture, although ratooning is practiced under unfavourable rainfall during the season.\\nCrops and cultivars: Crop combinations depend on climate, local preferences and other site-\\nspecific factors. Combination varies with differences in:\\n\\x7f Crop duration,\\n\\x7f Plant morphology,\\n\\x7f Root system,\\n\\x7f Stress tolerance,\\n\\x7f Density response,\\n\\x7f Resistance to pests and pathogens, and\\n\\x7f Yield stability.'),\n",

The base crop, necessarily in distinct row arrangement and its recommended optimum plant\\npopulation, is suitably combined with the additional plant density of the associated crop. The objective\\nis the intensification of cropping both in time and space dimensions and to raise productivity per unit\\narea by increasing the pressur e of plant population. It has better utilization of growth resources than\\nsole cropping. Generally, legumes and non-legumes are grown. The advantages associated with\\nintercropping are: (i) additional income from the companion crop, ( ii) if the principal crop is damaged\\ndue to unfavourable conditions like drought, flood, epidemics, etc., companion crop may give sustenance\\nincome, (iii) legumes grown as companion crops always benefit the principal crop through N-fixation\\nand also utilizes soil moisture from deeper soil layers, ( iv) quick growing companion crops always\\nsuppress the harmful weeds thriving in the inter-spaces of the principal crops, ( v) gainful utilization of\\nthe labourer by increasing more man days employment potential, ( vi) better utilization of growth\\nresources–nutrient, water, light and space, ( vii) less incidence of insect pests and diseases attack, and\\n(viii) less erosion losses. At the same time, there are several disadvantages of intercropping as ( i) the\\nfertilizer management is difficult because the nutrient requirement of the crops is different, (ii) difficulty\\nin harvesting because of different seeding time of crops, and ( iii) there are certain combinations which\\nsuppress the growth of another crop and may be conducive to insect pests and diseases.\\nSuccessful results from intercropping can be obtained provided a suitable companion crop is selected\\nto grow with the main crop. Before putting any intercrop with the main crops like sugarcane, maize,\\nsorghum, bajra, it is very essential to know the prerequisites of the companion crops such as soils and\\nwater requirement compatibility: competition for space , sunshine and air, compatibility for pests and\\ndiseases; duration and yielding potential and time of sowing and harvesting.

Row intercropping\\nRow intercropping is raised by wa y of additive and replacement series.\\n(a) Additive series: One crop (base crop) is raised in full population and in between the rows of\\nbase crop, intercrops are raised at less population level by adjusting or changing crop geometry of the\\nbase crop.\\n(b) Replacement series: By sacrificing certain proportion of population of one component crop,\\nanother component crop is introduced.\\nFor example, sorghum + cowpea at 2:1 ratio\\nIV. Relay intercropping\\nIt is interplanting or inter sowing of the succeeding cr op in the proceeding ann ual crops, succeeding\\ncrop is sown after the proceeding crop has reached the maturity stage but before the harvest of standing\\ncrop or it refers to planting of succeeding crop befor e the harvest of preceding crop. The planting of\\nsucceeding crop may be done before or after flowering, before or after the attainment of reproductive\\nstage, completion of active life cycle, senescence of leaves or attainment of physiological maturity of\\nthe crop. The common examples of relay cropping are maize-potato, maize-toria, maize-turnip, ragi-\\nhorse gram. The relay cropping is primarily done with the objectives ( i) to gain time for multiple\\ncropping, (ii) to plant the subsequent crops at their optimum planting date when the current crop harvest\\nis delayed, (iii) to avoid moisture stress in the post-rainy season, and ( iv) to avoid labour peaks at the\\nharvest of the first crop and planting of the second crop. Relay cropping is difficult in the closely spaced\\nand dense canopy cereals as sorghum or millets unless some rows are skipped.'),\n",

It\\nis aimed at maximum production per unit area per unit time wherein economic yields of compatible\\ncrop species are harvested from different heights.

It includes\\nsequential cropping, inter-cropping and mixed cropping. In simplest form, multiple cropping is a one-\\nyear cropping system in which two or more crops are grown within a year; if all the crops are cereals\\nit will resemble monoculture in its advantages and requirements. It may be pointed out that this pivotal\\ntheme of intensive cropping may manifest itself in various forms such as relay, inter or just multiple\\ncropping. In a broader sense, it is continuous cropping. If all the post-harvest operations are taken into\\nconsideration, then they are overlapping operations.\\nThe philosophy of multiple cropping is the maximum crop production per unit area with minimum\\nsoil deterioration; the requirement of multiple cropping underlying the suitability of variety which need\\nnot give maximum yield or returns during its specific period. Instead, it must match in a crop sequence\\nto give maximum return from production and use of resources over the full tern of one year or other\\nappropriate time span.\\n(b) Important considerations for multiple cropping: There are some important considerations for\\nmultiple cropping, such as ( i) the crop should be agro climatically suitable and technically feasible,\\n(ii) select most profitable crops ca pable to utilize growth resources and land in best manner, ( iii) the\\ncrop combinations and in put rations should be compatible with farmer’s skill, enterprise preference,\\nhealth, age and capital, ( iv) assured irrigation facility, ( v) local availability of essential inputs like\\nimproved seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, ( vi) stable marketing and storage facilities, ( vii) good transpor-\\ntation facilities, (viii) easy availability of credit, (ix) availability of cheap labour, and (x) proper adjust-\\nment of sowing and harvesting time of crops. A due consideration to all these points will make multiple\\ncropping successful and meaningful.\\n(c) Types:\\n1. Sequential cropping: It refers to growing two or more crops in sequence on the same field in\\na year. The succeeding crop is planted after the preceding crop has been harvested. Actually, crop\\nintensification is only in the time dimension. There is no intercrop competition. One has to manage only\\none crop at a time in the same field. Sequential cropping may be of many types as–(i) double cropping–\\ngrowing of two crops a year in sequence, (ii) triple cropping–growing of three crops a year in sequence,\\n(iii) quadruple cropping–growing of four crops a year in sequence and (iv) ratoon cropping – cultivation\\nof crop regrowth after harvest of plant crop, not necessarily for grain. Sequential cropping systems in\\nirrigated conditions are based on the availability of shor t duration, photo-insensitive and thermo-\\ninsensitivity high yielding varieties while cropping systems of short duration, photo-insensitive and'),\n",

Thus the net sown area is 136.18 m. ha (41.42 per cent of the total geographi-\\ncal area) (Subbaian et. al., 2000).\\nUnlike industries, agriculture is practiced by 105 m. farm families who live in 0.6 m. villages. More\\nthan 40 per cent of them are below the poverty line. Nearly 85 m. farm families belong to small and\\nmarginal categories. In spite of increase in food production, after the independence of the country, only\\nin north-western India, per capita food production has increased and it has declined in other parts of the\\ncountry. The per capita availability of land dur ing the same period has declined from 0.48–0.15 ha by\\n2000 A.D. Per capita investment in agricultural infrastr ucture is the lowest in eastern India, where the\\ndensity of population is the highest. Only 25–30 per cent of the modern agricultural technologies have\\nreached the farmers. This is often because the technology has not been consistent with conditions of the\\nfarm situations.\\nThe benefits of modern technology have, however, been restricted to favourable farming situations.\\nOnly 44 out of 453 districts are contributing half of the total food grain basket of the country. This\\nclearly suggests that the technology supposed to be scale and resource neutral has been confined to the\\ndistricts with favourable farming conditions. Since there is no further scope for horizontal expansion of\\nland for cultivation, the only alternative left is for vertical expansion and diversification of farm enterprises\\nwith less demand on space and time particularly  for small and marginal farmers (constituting 76 per\\ncent of the farming community) who do not have much of resources, specially in rainfed areas (70 per\\ncent of the total cultivated land). The new farming system research strategy should, therefore, necessarily\\nconcentrate on developing technology with participatory approach within the biophysical and socio-\\neconomic environments in which the farmers operate.\\n16.4.1 Present Research Thrust and its Limitations\\nThe existing programme of the ICAR is a component research and there is no system-based programme.\\nThe response of a component in isolation does not necessarily fit into a systems perspective. The\\nindividual programme ignores the socio-economic and biophysical aspects of the farming community.\\nThe limitations of the conventional model of agricultural research and extension in dealing with\\ninteractive matrix are well recognized. The reductionist component research approach curtails system\\nperspective resulting in wide gap in technology development and utilization particularly for the resource-\\npoor farmers. Systems research takes into consideration appropriate perspective in handling a complex\\nundertaking such as farm enterprises, diversification and their interaction on farm productivity. The\\nchallenge is to design practical integrated farming systems that can be adapted to regions, minimize\\nenergy and base inputs, and are sustainable. Design and implementation of integrated farming systems\\nrequire collaboration among agricultural, social, economic, and ecological disciplines. They also depend\\nupon the full participation of farmer. If may be probably impossible to develop efficient integrated\\nfarming systems without interdisciplinary planning and implementation. A major challenge to agricultural\\nresearch and development is the need for modifying institutional structures and research and development\\nmethodologies to allow such collaboration.\\n16.4.2 Definition\\nFarming system is a complex inter-related matrix of soil, plants, animals, implements, power, labour,\\ncapital and other inputs controlled in part by farming families and influenced to varying degrees by\\npolitical, economic, institutional and social forces that operate at many levels.

The farmers are subjected to many socio-economic, biophysi-\\ncal, institutional, administrative and technological constraints. Farming system conceptually is a set of\\nelements or components that are interrelated which interact among themselves. At the centre of the\\ninteraction is the farmer exercising control and choice regarding the type and results of interaction.\\nAny farming system, however, is subject to what is potentially possible in technical terms. It is the\\nhuman environment that provides sufficient condition for development and utilization of a particular\\nsystem. A farming system obviously is very complex. Therefore, any agricultural technology well\\nsuited to a particular agro-ecological situation and socio-economic environment may not be adopted by\\nother farmers. Unless both natural and human environments are considered, agricultural research will\\nnot result in relevant agricultur al technology. The income from cropping alone in small and marginal\\nfarms is hardly sufficient to sustain the farmers’ family. With the decline in farm size (0.15 ha) due to\\nexplosion of population, it would be increasingly difficult to produce enough food for the family by the\\nend of the century. Therefore, the farmer, to be assured of a regular income for a decent living (above\\nthe poverty line), a judicious mix of any one or more of these enterprises with agronomic crops should\\ncomplement the farm income and help in recycling the farm residue/waste. The selection of enterprises\\nmust be based on the cardinal principle of minimizing the competition and maximizing the\\ncomplementarily between the enterprises (Annadurai et. al., 1994b).\\n16.4.3 Development\\nWorld population has been increasing by leaps and bounds. India’s population is expected to reach\\n1370 and 1660 m. in 2030 and 2050 A.D. respectively. The country’s food production has reached an all\\ntime high of 204 m.t. during 2000. Food production level of 289 and 349 m.t. will be needed to satisfy\\nthe projected population in 2030 and 2050 A.D. respectively . The net cultivable area is 142.8 m ha.\\nUnlike the population spurt and corresponding food need f or 2050, there is every chance that the land\\narea under cultivation will decrease due to diversion of some of the cultivable area to buildings and\\nindustrial purposes. It is anticipated that the land area available for cultivation in 2050 would be 137 m\\nha. So, it becomes necessary to increase the productivity almost to double of what we are producing\\ntoday. This could be made possible by putting the land , both irrigated and rainfed, under intensive\\ncultivation. Fortunately most of our country lies in tropics and so is blessed with abundant solar energy,\\nthus making cropping round the year possible. The only way to increase agricultural production is to\\nincrease the productivity per unit area per unit time. The cropping systems, genotypes, geometry of\\nplanting and management practices are designed to increase the productivity, simultaneously making\\nefficient use of available resources and stabilising yields (Palaniappan and Annadurai, 1999).\\nModern agriculture emphasises two dimension viz., time and space. Time concept relates to increasing\\ncrop intensification in a situation where there is no constraint for inputs including irrigation. In other\\nwords increasing the cropping intensity in areas where the production potential viz., land is under\\nutilized even with full resource potential. It is a time bound program where, for most of the field crops,\\nit is considered for 365 days or 12 months. In the case of long duration and perennial crops the duration\\nof each rotation will vary from two or three years depending upon the duration of the constituent crops.\\nThe areas, where only one crop (100 per cent) two crops (200 per cent) three crops (300 per cent), are\\nraised in an year, leaving the land fallow for two to eight months the cropping intensity has to be\\nincreased to 200, 300 and 400 per cent respectively within one year. This will ultimately help to\\nenhance the productivity. In case of rainfed areas where there is no possibility of increasing the intensity\\nof cropping, the other concept viz., ‘space concept’ can be applied. By raising of crops/other agricultural\\nallied components in a vertical dimension, the land equivalent area can be increased. Thus by making'),\n",

This calls for urgent action on the part of Agronomists and Scientists of related\\ndisciplines to devote their attention on the design and testing of cropping systems for different regions.\\nIncome through arable farming alone is insufficient for bulk of the marginal farmers. Activities such as\\ndairying, poultry, fish culture, sericulture, biogas production, edible mushroom cultivation, agro forestry\\netc. assume, critical importance in supplementing their farm income. These activities fit well with farm\\nlevel infrastructure and ensure fuller utilisation of by-products.\\nIntegrated Farming System (IFS) is the answ er to increase food production and farm income and\\nfor improving nutrition of the small-scale farmers with limited resources without any adverse effect on\\nenvironment and agro-ecosystem. In a cropping system, the amount of by-products can be as high or\\nhigher than marketable produce. This may go to waste if not utilised in an animal enterprise. Hence,\\nintegration of different agricultural allied enterprises with crop activity as base will provide a way to\\nrecycle low cost produces at farm level/no cost waste materials of farm from one enterprises to another\\nand thus reduce the cost of production of the economic produce and finally to enhance the net income\\nof the farm as whole (Annadurai et al.,1994a).\\n16.4.4 Characteristics of an Improved Farming System\\nSustainable system must ( a) maintain the long-term biological and ecological integrity of natural\\nresources, (b) sustain a desirable level of support to a farm ’s, community’s or regions social, political,\\nand economic well being, and ( c) enhance quality of life. To be operational, however, sustainability\\nmust have tangible and objective criteria ( e.g., soil and water conservation, productivity restoration,\\nimprovement in water quality in relation to dissolved and suspended loads, a positive thermodynamic\\nenergy balance, improvement in air quality, reduction in use of off-farm input for the same level of\\nproduction and profitability, and acceptable lif e style as influenced by socio-political factors). All of\\nthese criteria are quantifiable but also have a time dimension. Over what period of time are these\\nchanges desired or achieved-months, years, decades, or centuries? Is the system that we desire to\\nachieve closed, static, steady state, or dynamic? Obviously, closed or static systems, through ecologically\\nstable, are not productive enough to meet present demands and future needs. Because the system is\\ndynamic, what is the energy flux involved in terms of output/input ratio and what is the carrying\\ncapacity of such a system? It is not only the energy efficiency but also the total energy flux that is very\\nimportant in sustainability. What are the indirect costs of achieving such a goal? Indirect costs are\\nindeed important factors to be considered. For example, reducing the use of off-farm input may necessitate\\nbringing additional land into production. The latter may be marginal, subject to severe problems of\\naccelerated erosion and other degraded processes. Substitution of inorganic fertilizers with organic\\namendments like green manure may equally endanger the quality of surface and ground water. Will\\nsubstitution of input by management have serious social and economic implications?\\nSustainability must be assessed at differ ent levels or hierarchies ( e.g., technology, sub-system, or\\nsystem). Therefore, the choice of a criterion to assess sustainability would depend on the hierarchy to\\nbe evaluated. Agronomic yields and productivity ar e useful criteria at the level of crop or cropping\\nsystem. Profit rather than production is the suitable criter ion at the level of farm household or farming\\nsystem. An assured supply of raw materials, off-farm income, and preserving the productive potential\\nof land resources and environmental quality are appropriate criteria for evaluating the sustainability of\\na community or a region. A system sustainable at a lower level (crop or cropping system) may, however,\\nnot be sustainable at a higher level (community or nation).'),\n",

It provides a\\nlivelihood to half of the world’s population even today. According to the Food and Agricultural Organi-\\nsation (FAO), people in the developing world where the population increase is very rapid, may face\\nhunger if the global food production does not rise by 50–60 per cent. The contribution of developing\\ncountries to world agricultural production in 1975 was about 38 per cent, while that of developed\\ncountries, which account for 33 per cent of world’s population, was 62 per cent. Only those countries,\\nwhich can match the demands of the increasing population with increased production, can escape mass\\nhunger. In the pre-independence period, Indian agriculture was usually described as a gamble with\\nmonsoons. There used to be a great deal of uncertainty about crop prospects, as monsoons played a\\ndecisive role in determining agricultural output and their failures resulted in widespread famine and\\nmisery. In the last few years, Indian agriculture has made impressive progress and so is more resilient\\nto the vagaries of the monsoon, although the country’s population increased from 361 million in 1951\\nto more than one billion in 2005.\\nDuring this period, the size of farm holdings and the per capita availability of agricultural land have\\nalso been decreasing and they are expected to be around 1.4 and 0.14 hectares respectively, by the turn\\nof this century (Table 17.1). With competing demands on land for other sectors of development, this\\ndecline is likely to aggravate further.\\nTable 17.1.

Farming was highly\\ndecentralised with individual farmers deciding on the types of crops to grow depending on climate and\\nsoil conditions. These traditions consisted of methods for controlling pests and diseases, and for build-\\ning soil fertility and structure in their own ingenious ways, since farm ing did not include the use of\\nchemical pesticides or fertilizers. Rather, soil health and pest control were achieved using practises such\\nas shifting cultivation, conservation, the use of animal manures and farm wastes and the introduction\\nof legumes into crop rotations. By growing a mixture of crops in the fields, early farmers insulted\\nthemselves from total crop failure caused by weather or pest epidemics. Even, Alexander Walker,\\nresident at Baroda in Gujarat, wrote in 1820 that green fodder was being grown throughout the year;\\nintercropping, crop rotation, fallo wing, composting and manuring were practised; all these allowed\\ncontinued farming on the same land for more than 2000 years without drop in yields. Further, the crops\\nwere relatively free from pests. One of the reasons for the decline in their sustainable system of\\nagriculture was the land revenue collected by the British. A tax of 50 per cent and sometimes as much\\nas 63 per cent revenue was collected and hence more than a third of the irrigated land went out of\\nproduction. Similarly, an environmentally stable form of tree and forest conservation, which had been\\ndeveloped over the ages, crumbled. Even sacred groves, which were preserved since time immemorial,\\nwere turned into coffee, tea, teak wood and sugarcane plantations. Hence, from 1865 through 1900\\nIndia experienced the most severe series of protracted famines in its entire history.\\n17.2 THE GREEN REVOLUTION\\nAfter the green revolution was launched in India, substantial increase in the production of food grains\\nwas achieved through the use of improved crop var ieties and higher levels of inputs of fertilizers and\\nplant protection chemicals. But it has now been realised that the increase in production was achieved'),\n",

In fact, about 60 per cent of our\\nagricultural land currently under cultivation suffers from indiscriminate use of irrigation water and\\nchemical fertilizers. The gravity of environmental degradation resulting from faulty agricultural prac-\\ntices has caused alarm among the concerned farmers, scientists and conservationalists and greater\\nviable and sustainable farming systems have become a necessity. There has been a series of scientists\\nand policy conference on this issue. One such alternative agriculture system which will help to over-\\ncome the problems of soil degradation and declining soil fe rtility is organic farming and ecological\\nagriculture.\\nMost of the growth in the food production during the green revolution period is attributed to the\\nhigher fertilizer use. The growth of the fertilizer industry in India between 1965 and 1983 has been\\nremarkable. The per hectare consumption of NPK increases from 0.6 kg in 1950 – 50 kg by 1987–88.\\nHowever, the available data show that the fertilizer consumption is largely confined to irrigated areas\\nwhich constitute only about 30 per cent of the gross cropped area. The annual fertilizer consumption\\nis expected to rise to about 20 million tonnes by the turn of this century. This rise in fertilizer use is\\nanticipated because:\\n\\x7f N deficiency will continue to be universal in Indian soils.\\n\\x7f Deficiency of P will be next in the order.\\n\\x7f K will become limiting in high productive regions.\\n\\x7f In at least half of the Indian soils, crops would benefit from Zn treatment.\\n\\x7f S deficiency will limit the productivity in a vast majority of Indian soils.\\n17.2.1 Impact of Green Revolution on the Environment\\nTo increase the agricultural production in the country and to meet the requirements of the expanding\\npopulation, it became imperative to change the methodologies of crop production. These involved the\\nuse of high-yielding varieties and higher fertilizer dosages; increasing the irrigated area and intensive\\ncropping; bringing large areas under one crop; growing crops in non-conventional areas; and changing\\nthe crop sequences. The green revolution followed the development of commercial agriculture in the\\ndeveloped countries after World War II, Chemical companies that developed highly toxic and life\\ndamaging chemicals for the purpose of warfare, decided to turn their attention on the chemical control\\nof insects, pests and unwanted plants in the farmer’s fields. In addition, the production of petroleum-\\nbased fertilizers by oil companies was used to replace composts and manures. The food grain produc-\\ntion increased dramatically as the policies of green revolution began to take effect. By the year 2000,\\nIndia will need to produce 230 million tons of food grains on 140 million hectares of agricultural land\\nin order to feed an estimated 1 billion Indians.\\nThis achievement, though remarkable, has also coasted us dearly. Along with the increase of food\\ngrain production pesticide consumption in India also increased considerably. In 1932 nearly 200 metric\\ntons of chemical pesticides were used, but by 1975 it was 25,000 metric tons, an astounding 375 fold\\nincrease over 30 years. Despite increasing use of pesticides, annual crop losses due to pests still amount\\nto more than 15,000 crores. Consumption of chemical fertilizers has gone up seven times in the last 20\\nyears, but production has only increased a miserable two-fold. While we now have enough food our-\\nselves and are concentrating on broadening our food exports, we have apparently sadly overlooked on\\nequitable food distribution to our hungry millions. It is quite unfair to balance our country’s trade\\ndeficit, caused by expanding imports of petroleum-based products with food exports at the expense of\\nmaking the same available for local consumption.

In the past , our fore-fathers were consuming chemical-free\\nfoods, but now a large quantity of chemical residues getting into the food chain and toxic residues in\\nagricultural commodities is an issue of major concern to everybody.\\nOur major concern is to meet the internal demands of farm production without degrading the\\nproductive environment. Sustainability issues have become highly relevant even under the low input\\nuse situations. There is hardly any scope of finding new land area suitable for cultivation. Since the\\nability of the land to produce food is limited and the limits of production are set by soil and climatic\\nconditions, there are critical levels of population that can be supported in perpetuity from any given\\nland area. Any attempt to produce food in excess for the restrictions set by soil and climatic conditions\\nwill, in the long term, result in failure. Degradation of land, hunger and eventual reduction in population\\nare the outcome of such practises. However, the application of technological innovations in the form of\\nnew seeds, fertilizers, irrigation and suitable management str ategies has bailed such catastrophic pre-\\ndictions in the past. This underscores the tremendous potential of science and shows the possibility of\\nmeeting the demands put on our farm production systems without reducing its sustainability, through\\nscientific research.\\nThe progress in Indian agriculture during the last 40 years can be broadly classified under three\\nareas: First, progress in developing the research and educational infrastructure, essential for generating\\nand testing technologies suitable for different agr o-ecological regions, secondly, a reasonably efficient\\ninput production and delivery system for the production and distribution of seeds, fertilisers and other\\ninputs. Thirdly, evolving policies essential for stimulating higher production by small farmers and\\nincreased consumption by the rural and urban poor. T hanks to these steps, growth of food production\\nhas on the whole remained above the rate of population growth. Statistics on agricultural production in\\nIndia from 1960–1988 show that during the period (a) the gross cropped area increased marginally; (b)\\nthe area under irrigation nearly doubled; (c ) the high yielding variety progr amme, initiated at the\\nnational level in 1966, increased to cover nearly 39 per cent of the cropped area; ( d) the total food\\nproduction increased from 74 million tonnes to nearly 174 millions tonnes; and ( e) both the fertiliser\\nand pesticide consumption increased more than 25 times.  The ratio of pesticide to fertilizer remained\\nnearly constant at 1:100. Interestingly, the use of pesticides in the public health sector, which has higher\\nthan in the agricultural sector until 1966, became almost equal in 1970 and declined significantly\\nthereafter. The number of pesticides used in agricultural sector has always been a more diversified than\\nin public health sector which used only DDT, HCH and malathion.\\nThe introduction of high-yielding varieties changed the agricultural environment leading to numerous\\npest problems of economic importance. Many of these were either unknown or were minor importance\\nin the early 1960’s. Increased irrigation, higher usage of fertilizers and wide adoption of high-yielding\\nvarieties led to the resurgence of pests. The high-yielding varieties and the monoculture practices led\\nto material changes in the pest complex. Pests and diseases such as gall midge, brown plant hopper,\\nbacterial blight and tungro virus of rice, whic h were of minor importance before the green revolution,\\nsuddenly assumed major proportions; for instance, S podoptera litura on cotton, maize and tobacco;\\nPyrilla on wheat, maize and sorghum; apple scab and codling moth on apple and Karnal bunt on wheat\\nincreased the crop losses due to pests enormously.

In a constant struggle to survive, farm  communities have developed numerous ways of\\nobtaining food and fiber from plants and animals (TA C/CGAIR, 1988). A wide range of different\\nfarming systems have been developed, each adapted to the local ecological conditions (Okigbo, 1978)\\nRichards, 1988: Dupre, 1990). A closer look at these traditional farming systems reveals that they are\\nnot static; they have changed over the generations–and particularly quickly over the last few\\ndecades–primarily as a result of the research and development activities of the local people. (Wieskel,\\n1989; Owasu, 1990). However, rapid changes in economic, technological and demographic conditions\\ndemand adjustments in smallholder farming systems. New market opportunities, promotion of chemical\\ninputs and financial constraints may lead farmers to seek short term profits and pay less attention to\\nkeeping their agriculture in balance with the ecological conditions. In recent years, the negative\\nenvironmental and soil impacts of High External Input Agriculture (HEIA) have become increasingly\\nobvious (Wali, 1992; NRC, 1993). At the same time, many disadvantaged communities of smallholders\\nare being forced to exploit the resources available to them so intensively that, environmental degradation\\nis setting in. Hence, it is important to seek new approaches to agricultural de velopment, which will\\nbenefit small farmers, half degradation of natural resources and restore degraded soils and ecosystems.\\nIn 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, 1987) called attention\\nto the immense problems and c hallenges facing world agriculture for meeting present and future food\\nneeds, and to the need for a new approach to agricultural development. The agricultural systems that\\nhave been developed over the past few decades have contributed greatly to the alleviation of hunger and\\nthe raising of standard of living of poor people (Dora, 1983; Wilken, 1987) who have served their\\npurposes up to a point. But they were developed for the purposes of a smaller, more fragmented world.\\nHowever, new realities reveal their inherent contradictions, realities while require agricultural systems\\nthat focus as much attention on people as they do on technology, as much on resources as on produc-\\ntion, as much on the long term as on the short term.

Concept\\nThe use of modern farming practices has greatly enhanced the productivity of crops. However, the\\nhazards of the use of agricultural chemicals in causing eco-de gradation have prompted many to think\\nrationally and evolve alternatives. The negative impact of pesticides on the environment has been well\\ndocumented. Pesticides are not specific to the target organisms and kill many useful organisms, thus\\nupsetting the food web in nature. Further, some resistant pests survive even after pesticide application;\\ntherefore, higher doses are r equired to kill them. The pesticide residues in the food chain have endan-\\ngered the life sustaining systems. Finally, lack of safety measures in the use of pesticides pose adverse\\nhealth effects on people. The synthetic fertilizers have also jeopardized the environment through nitrate\\npoisoning and exter minating the beneficial soil microflora and microfauna by adversely altering the\\nchemical and physical properties of the soil. Though the agricultural extension personnel are aware of\\nthe ill effects of modern technology, they are helpless without an effective alternative system. There-\\nfore, the need for sustainable and ecolog ical agriculture is increasingly felt in the world.\\nSustainable agriculture is also referred by other names such as alternative agriculture, ecological\\nagriculture and natural organic farming. It is that form of farming which maintains or enhances the flow\\nof its products without damaging its own long ter m potential. The United States National Research\\nCouncil (1989) defined alternative agriculture as “those alternative systems incorporating natural\\nprocesses reducing the use of inputs of off-farm sources, ensuring the long term sustainability of\\ncurrent production levels and conserving soil, water, ener gy and biological resource: Organic farming\\nis an agricultural production system, which avoids or largely excludes the use of systematically\\ncompounded fertilizers and pesticides. To the maximum extent feasible, organic farming systems rely\\nupon crop rotations, crop residues, animal manures, legumes, green manures to maintain soil productivity\\nand tilth to supply plant nutrients. It looks forward to alternative methods of pest-control like pest\\nresistant cultivars, bio-control agents and cultural methods of pest-control. Such ecological farming\\nsystems are highly productive and they should not be mistaken for a reversion to inefficient and less\\nproductive farming methods. The adoption of ecological farming is not as simple as one may presume.\\nIt is highly knowledge intensive, la bour-oriented and a complex system integrating several organic\\nrecycling processes.\\nB. Basic principles\\nPrinciple: The use of limited quantities of fertilizers and discrete application of small quantities of\\ntarget specific pesticides at critical stages of crop dama ge thereby overcoming the effects of modern\\nagriculture.\\nThe following seven principles will have to be kept in view to achieve success in promoting\\necological agriculture:\\n\\x7f Based on both biological potential and biological dive rsity, land can be classified into conserva-\\ntion, restoration and sustainable intensification areas. Conservation areas are rich in biological\\ndiversity and must be protected in their pristine purity. Soils with diminished biological potential\\nare also referred as w aste or degraded lands and it should be improved through the adoption of\\nprinciples of restoration ecology. The diversion of land suitable for sustainable farming should be\\nprevented by legislation.

There is a need for reduction in the use\\nof market purchased inputs and not of inputs per se. It is in this context integrated systems of\\nnutrient supply assume importance. The components of the integrated nutrient supply system\\nsuitable for easy adoption include crop rotation, green manures and biofertilizers. Biodynamic\\nsystems that make significant use of compost and humus will help improve soil structure and\\nfertility.\\n\\x7f Genetic diversity and location specific varieties are essential for achieving sustainable advances\\nin productivity. Genetic homogeneity characteristic of modern agricultural systems only leads to\\ngreater genetic vulnerability to biotic and abiotic stresses. Diversity of crops and crop varieties\\nwill help enhance the yield stability.\\n\\x7f The control of weeds, insect pests and pathogens is one of the most challenging jobs in agricul-\\nture. Therefore, an integrated pest management system needs adoption. The conservation and\\nwise use of genetic diversity is essential f or breeding strains possessing multiple resistances to\\nbiotic and abiotic stresses. Similarly, the conserva tion of natural enemies of pests is important\\nfor minimizing the use of chemical pesticides and for avoiding the multiplication of insecticide\\nresistant pests.

Feasibility\\nThe shift from chemical to ecological ag riculture should be gradual. A sudden switch over could spell\\ndisaster and discourage farmers from taking to this course. At least seven to eight years will be needed\\nfor the transition and during the interim years the farmers could build up a sufficient organic base to\\nfertilize the fields and improve the fertility of soil. From a purely ecological point of view, ecological\\nfarms should have more diversity of species of plants, which invite different species of birds and\\nbeneficial insects. As ecological equilibrium is established, the build up of specific pests and pathogens\\nis significantly reduced.\\nThe biggest problem faced by most ecological farmers is that they do not know how to start\\nswitching the transition phase, which poses a great challenge, and they do not have any information on\\nhow to shift. There is no organized extension machinery to disseminate the proven technologies and in\\nmany cases the basis information itself is not available. When the farmers proceed to change the soil\\nfertility using organic manures, they often ignore other aspects of the farming system. For instance, they\\nforget the plant protection aspect. There are no immediate alternatives available to chemical control in\\nthe market. One has to develop effective alternati ves. So far they are only left with the adoption of\\npreventive methods. Simple changes in transition lead to complications in pest and disease manage-\\nment. Plant derived products are there but they are not as effective as synthetically compounded ones\\nand therefore cannot be an efficient substitute . Farmers should get trained in pest monitoring.

But what does it really mean?\\nAccording to a dictionary definition, ‘sustainability’ refers to ‘keeping an effort going continuously, the\\nability to last out and keep from falling’. In the context of agriculture, ‘sustainability’ basically refers\\nto the capacity to remain productive while maintaining the resource base. For example, the Technical\\nAdvisory Committee of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (TAC/CGIAR\\n1988) states: “sustainable agriculture is the successful management of resources for agriculture to\\nsatisfy changing human needs while maintaining or enhancing the quality of the environment and\\nconserving natural resources”.\\nHowever, many people use a wider definition, judg ing agriculture to be sustainable if it is (after\\nGips 1986);\\n\\x7f Ecologically sound, which means that the quality of natural resources is maintained and the\\nvitality of the entire agro-ecosystem from humans, crop and animals to soil organisms–is enhanced.\\nThis is best ensured when the soil is managed and the health of crops, animals and people is\\nmaintained through biological processes (self-regulation). Local resources are used in a way that\\nminimizes losses of nutrients, biomass and energy, and avoids pollution. Emphasis is on the use\\nof renewable resources.\\n\\x7f Economically viable, which means that farmers can produce enough for self-sufficiency and/or\\nincome, and gain sufficient returns to warrant the labour and costs involved. Economic viability\\nis measured not only in terms of direct farm produce (yield) but also in terms of functions such\\nas conserving resources and minimizes risks.\\n\\x7f Socially just, which means that resources and power are distributed in such a way that the basic\\nneeds of all members of society are met and their rights to land use, adequate capital, technical\\nassistance and market opportunities are assured. All people have the opportunity to participate\\nin decision-making, in the field and in the society. Social unrest can threaten the entire social\\nsystem, including agriculture.\\n\\x7f Humane, which means that all forms of life (plant, animal, human) are respected.

Therefore, well-functioning\\ninstitutions and well deliberated polices are needed on all levels-from village to global in order to\\nensure sustainable development.\\nIn agricultural development, raising production is often given primary attention. But there is an\\nupper limit to the productivity of ecosystems. If this is exceeded, an ecosystem will degrade and may\\neventually collapse, and fewer people will be able to survive on the remaining resources than before.\\nThis implies that, when the limits on the supply side are reached, something has to be done on the\\ndemand side, e.g. other sources of income, emigration, lower consumption level, and population con-\\ntrol. Production and consumption have to be brought into balance on an ecologically sustainable level.\\nAlthough sustainability must be seen as a dynamic concept, which allows for the changing needs of an\\nincreasing global population (TAC/CGIAR, 1988), basic ecological principles oblige us to recognize\\nthat agricultural productivity has finite limits.\\nWhy has the concept of sustainability gained increasing importance with reference to agricultural\\ndevelopment? This becomes evident if we take a look at the present situation of world agriculture. The\\nGoal of sustainable agriculture is to feed the expanding population while farming in an economically\\nsound and regenerative way.

Modern\\nagricultural systems are capital intensive. Economic returns require use of high level of inputs. Injudicious\\nuse of input leads to environmental pollution. Such system does not endure long. A farming system to\\nbe sustainable should have the capacity to endure indefinitely. Therefore the ultimate goal of sustainable\\nagriculture is “ to develop farming system that are: (a) productive, (b) profitable, (c) conserve the\\nnatural resource base, (d) protect the environment, and (e) enhance soil health and safety over a long\\nterm’. Hence, this can be referred as Eco-friendly Agriculture.\\n17.3.3 Sustainability through Farming Systems\\nTwo farming systems have been proposed for enduring sustainability.

However, it is also open to question whether it will be possible to raise world food\\nproduction sufficiently without the use of such external inputs. Besides, natural as opposed to artificial\\ninputs can also have detrimental environmental effects.\\nLEISA is an option which is feasible for a large number of farmers and which can complement\\nother forms of agricultural production. As most farmers are not in a position to use artificial inputs or\\ncan use them only in small quantities, it is necessary to concentrate on technologies that make efficient\\nuse of local resources. Also, those farmers who now practice HEIA could reduce contamination and\\ncosts and increase the efficiency of the external inputs by applying some LEISA techniques. It is\\nimportant that the agro-ecological knowledge of both scientists and farmers can be applied, so that\\ninternal and external inputs can be combined in such a way that the natural resources are conserved and\\nenhanced. Productivity and security are increased and negative environmental effects are avoided.\\nA. LEISA refers to those forms of agriculture that\\n\\x7f Seek to optimize the use of locally available resources by combining the different components\\nof the farm system, i.e., plants, animals, soil, water, climate and people, so that they complement\\neach other and have the greatest possible synergetic effects.\\n\\x7f Seek ways of using external inputs only to the extent that they are needed to provide elements\\nthat are deficient in the ecosystem and to enhance available biological, physical and human\\nresources. In using external inputs, attention is given mainly to maximum recycling and minimum\\ndetrimental impact on the environment.\\n\\x7f LEISA does not aim at maximum production of short duration but rather at a stable and adequate\\nproduction level over the long term. LEISA seeks to maintain and, where possible, enhance the\\nnatural resources and make maximum use of natural processes. Where part of the production is\\nmarketed, opportunities are sought to regain  the nutrients brought to the market.\\nNumerous developing countries are now implementing so-called structural adjustment programs\\nthat involve policies such as devaluation of exchange rates, reduction of government spending and\\nintervention, reduction of subsidies and removal of price controls. In this way, the demand for imports\\nis to be curtailed and the purchase of local goods stimulated, so as to reduce the balance of payment and\\ngovernment deficits and to promote national economic growth. LEISA appears to fit within this context,\\nas it is less demanding on imports and credits than the conventional approach to agricultural development.\\nAt farm, regional and national level, LEISA i mplies the need for closely monitoring and carefully\\nmanaging flows of nutrients, water and energy in order to achieve a balance at a high level of production.\\nManagement principles include harvesting water and nutrients from the watershed, recycling nutrients\\nwithin the farm, managing nutrient  flow from farm to consumer s and back again, using aquifer water\\njudiciously, and using renewable sources of energy. As these flows are not confined by farm boundaries,\\nLEISA requires management not only at farm level but also at district, regional, national and even\\ninternational levels. At each level, technologies are sought to make the flow cycle as short as possible\\nand to balance the flows.

The experience thus far of developing LEISA systems\\ncannot provide universal, ready-made answers for the problems of farmers in other areas, but can\\nprovide some indications of principles and promising possibilities.\\nThe process of combining local farmers’ knowledge and skills with those of external agents to\\ndevelop site-specific and socio economically adapted farming techniques has been given the name ‘partici-\\npatory Technology Development’ (PTD). Farmers work together with professionals from outside their\\ncommunity (e.g., extension workers, researchers etc.) in identifying, generating, testing and applying new\\ntechniques. PTD seeks to strengthen the existing experimental capacity of farmers, and to encourage\\ncontinuation of the innovation process under local control (Haverkort, et al., 1988).

This\\napproach to agricultural development appears to be better adapted to the needs and opportunities of\\nLEIA farmers and to fit better into their cultural context than the conventional approach.\\nB. Sustainable agroecosystems\\nAn alternative to the chemical dependence is to maximize the contributions of bio diversity to pest\\ncontrol and nutrient cycling and to attain optimal productivity with minimal inputs. Edwards and Grove\\n(1991) proposed an analogous term for management of nutrients, integrated nutrient management. This\\napproach capitalizes the adaptive features of traditional systems and incorporates additional advantages\\nof conventional and innovative technology. It is important to recognize a strong link between the\\navailability of organic matter and both bio di versity and nutrient cycling (Palm et. al., 1987). The\\npractice in many developing countries of removing organic matter from the land for fuel and other\\npurposes is a serious constraint to long-term sustainability (Oram, 1988). The most sustainable farming\\npractices and components of the man managed bio dive rsity can be developed only by understanding\\nthe functions of the agro ecosystem and low social and economic conditions of the farmers and their\\nclimatic and environments impact upon overall crop and animal productivity.

Energy use: The increased use of fertilizers has been possible due to increase of energy input\\nfor fertiliser production. Although in developing countries about 70 per cent of the commercial energy\\nused in agriculture goes in the production of chemical fertilisers as against 35 per cent in developed\\ncountries; total consumption is more in developed countries which account for only 37 per cent of the\\ntotal agricultural area. Thus, the scope for reducing energy consumption in developing countries is\\nmarginal.\\n2. Monocropping: The crop yields increased greatly in developed countries over last 50 years and\\nin developing countries during last 20 years. Most of these ar e due to development of varieties, which\\nrespond well to fertilisers. The different types of cropping systems practised in traditional agriculture\\nhave given way to system involving only few crops, which are highly nutrient depleting. The legumes,\\ngrasses and millets which are regular components of cropping systems in Indian agriculture have\\nlargely been phased out in highly productive areas and replaced by high yielding rice, wheat, sugarcane,\\netc. This has created the problems of soil er osion and disturbances to soil and wild life habitats.\\n3. Imbalance of nutrients and decrease in soil productivity: There is increasing concern on the\\nrole of fertilizers in maintaining long term soil productivity. In intensive agriculture with high yielding\\ncrop varieties, crop yields will be drastically reduced due to decline in the soil nutrient reserves. Long\\nterm use of only chemical (N) fertilisers also has adverse effect on soil physical properties such as bulk\\ndensity, hydraulic conductivity and stability of aggregates. The deterioration in soil due to intensive\\ncultivation can be easily arrested by the balanced use of bulky organic measure such as FYM and\\ncompost.\\n4. Pollution: Greater use of synthetic N and P fertilisers has given rise to concern amongst envi-\\nronmental and health specialists. The N fertilisers create health and ecological hazards due to presence\\nof excess nitrate in drinking water; eutrophication of lakes and streams and depletion of stratospheric\\nozone due to nitrous oxide production from denitrification. The continued application of P fertilisers to\\nagricultural lands can result in the build up of tr ace metal contaminants such as arsenic and cadmium\\ncontained in the fertiliser. Although the mobility of P in soil is low, transport of P from agricultural soils\\nto aquatic environment in runoff can result in deterioration of water quality.\\nSo to avoid the toxic effects we can go for biological agriculture whic h attempts to provide a\\nbalanced environment, in which the maintenance of soil fertility and control of pests and diseases are\\nachieved by the enhancement of natural processes and cycles, with only moderate inputs of energy and\\nresources while maintaining optimum productivity.\\nThe rapidly growing population is also cau sing serious environmental problems and degrading\\nnatural resources that are essential to agriculture. Some of these problems are discussed below:\\n1. Soil erosion: In recent decades more and more forest and grasslands have been cleared and\\nconverted to crop fields. At the same time effective traditional soil conservation techniques have been\\nabandoned. Thus soil erosion has become a serious and growing threat to sustained agricultural\\nproductivity. Man’s increasing impact on the environment is resulted in a world-wide tendency towards\\ndegradation and erosion of soils. In Britain, 44 per cent of the arable land is subjected to erosion.

In worst areas the loss is as high as 50 tonnes per ha\\nin a single year. Soil Scientists estimate that if fields repeatedly lose more than 2 t per ha, yields of\\ncereals would fall permanently. In China the annual erosion rate is 50–70 t/ha/year and in India, it is\\nabout 16 t/ha/year. After years of intensive cultivation, the thickness of top soil has reduced from\\n60–70 cm to only 20–30 cm. Approximately 0.5 cm of top soil is lost annually. The seriousness of this\\nsituation becomes apparent when it is recognised that soil is formed only at a pproximately 1 t/ha/yr.\\n2. Decrease in organic matter: Severe erosion results in reduction of organic matter in the soil, the\\nmore organic matter in the soil the more stable it is. A stable soil is also more porous allowing water\\nto drain rapidly from the surface. Water that does not penetrate the soil, runs off the surface taking soil\\nwith it. Changing in farming techniques led to deple tion of organic matter in the soils. Farmers have\\nceased rotating grass with crops. Pasture crops maintain or even raise the amount of organic matter in\\nthe soil whereas continuous arable cropping tends to reduce these levels. Also inorganic fertilisers have\\nlargely replaced organic manures. Grass crops not only increase the amount of organic matter but also\\npermanently cover the ground affording greater protection to erosion by rain. Organic farming tech-\\nniques will help to increase the organic matter content of soils, thus reducing the bulk density and\\ndecreasing compaction. There can be effective conservation systems since they provide soil cover\\nduring most of the year and with the greater use of rotations and green manure crops, crop residues and\\nlegumes, there is an increased emphasis on manure as a source of soil fertility. So unlike under conven-\\ntional and monocropping systems, due to maintenance of crop cover during greater part of the year\\nthere is a little runoff and erosion. Modern concept of conservation tillage is effective to reduce erosion\\nbut it employs excessive use of herbicides, w hich are hazardous to our environment.\\nSoil organic matter is one of the important components of the soil. The dead plant and animal\\nremains and dead microbial tissues form the main source of soil organic matter. V arious organic matter\\nlike farmyard manure, compost, green manure etc. that are added to the soil from time to time further\\nadd to the store of organic matter. These added organic undergo a series of microbial decompositions\\nand finally humus is formed (light bulky amorphous material of dark brown to black colour). Tropical\\nsoils are generally low in organic matter content. Sandy soils contain less organic matter than loams and\\nloams contain less than clay soils. The low organic matter is primarily due to climate particularly due\\nto high temperature and secondarily due to cultural practices. In tropical and sub-tropical regions\\nalthough much organic matter is produced, it decays very rapidly. Whatever organic matter added to the\\nsoils will be decomposed (over 90 per cent in a year) and hence, it is Herculean task to raise the organic\\nmatter content of the soil. In cultivatable soils, the organic matter content ranges from less than 1 per\\ncent to 15 per cent. The peat soils contain more than 90 per cent organic matter.\\nD. Concept and Definition\\nThe concept of organic agriculture has been perceived differently by different people. To most of them,\\nit implies the use of organic manures and natural methods of plant protection instead of using synthetic\\nfertilisers and pesticides. It is regarded by some as farming involving the integrated use of fertilisers and\\norganic manures as well as of chemicals and natural inputs for plant protection. In either case the\\nconcept has been understood only partially.\\nOrganic agriculture has been defined differently , but the description offered by Lampkin (1990)\\nappears to be most comprehensive one covering all essential features. As per this description, organic\\nagriculture is a production system, which avoids or largely excludes the use of synthetic compounded\\nfertilisers, pesticides, growth regulators and livestock feed additives. To the maximum extent feasible,\\norganic farming system rely on crop rotations, crop residues, animal manures, legumes, green manures,\\noff-farming organic wastes and aspect of biological pest control to maintain soil productivity and tilth,'),\n",

The concept of soil as living\\nsystem that develops the activities of beneficial organisms is central to the definition.\\nOrganic agriculture does not imply the simple replacement of synthetic fertilisers and other chemical\\ninputs with organic inputs and biologically active fo rmulations. Instead, it envisages a comprehensive\\nmanagement approach to improve the health of underlying productivity of the soil. In a healthy soil, the\\nbiotic and abiotic components covering organic matter including soil life, mineral particles, soil air and\\nwater exist in a stage of dynamic equilibrium and regulate the ecosystem processes in mutual harmony\\nby complementing and supplementing each other. When the soil is in good health, the population of soil\\nfauna and flora multiplies rapidly which, in turn, will sustain the bio-chemical process of dissolution\\nand synthesis at a high rate. This state of soil life and the associated organic transformations will\\nenhance the regenerative capacity of the soil and make it resilient to absorb the effects of climatic\\nfactors and occasional failures in agronomic management.\\nThe success of organic agriculture depends to a great extent on the efficiency of agronomic\\nmanagement adopted to stimulate and augment the underlying productivity of the soil resource. In this\\ncontext, the concept of agro-ecosystem becomes relev ant. A farming system unit is treated as a agro-\\necosystem when it attains the semblance of a forest ecosystem in species diversity and multiplicity. The\\nadoption of sequence and mixed cropping models in the presence of compatible species of nitrogen\\nfixing trees with or without the association of livestock components makes the agro-ecosystem benefit\\nfrom the positive interaction and the stimulated cycling mechanisms. As a consequence, the system\\nslowly achieves self-regulation and stability. Agriculture production attained at this stage will be engaging\\nwithout eroding or deteriorating the natural resource base.\\nAs the OAS derives it strength from the primary education capacity of the soil and complimentary\\ninteraction among the components of the system, the use of chemical inputs either for soil fertility\\nmanagement or for plant protection is excluded. This renders the system free from the pollution problems\\nusually associated with the use of such inputs. For achieving marked improvement in soil productivity\\nand for sustaining optimum levels of biological production, OAS lays emphasize on appropriate cropping\\nand farming models, ensuring on-farm diversity and nutrient cycling, conservation and use of organic/\\nbiological sources of nutrients, cultural practices conducive to the conservation of soil and water resources\\nand natural and or biological methods of pest and disease suppression.\\nWith an understanding of the principles of org anic agriculture, a straight and simple definition to\\nthe concept can be suggested. Organic agriculture is a farming system devoid of chemical inputs, in\\nwhich the biological potential of the soil and underground water resources are conserved and protected\\nfrom the natural and human induced degradation or depletion by adopting suitable cropping models\\nincluding agro forestry and methods of organic replenishment; besides natural and biological means are\\nused for pest and disease management by which the soil life and beneficial interaction are stimulated\\nand sustained. The system achieves self regulation and stability as well as capacity to produce agricul-\\ntural outputs at levels, which are profitable and enduring over time, and, at the same time, consistent\\nwith the carrying capacity of the managed agro-ecosystem.\\nThere are also different opinions on nomenc lature of organic farming. Some call it as ecofarming\\ni.e., farming in relation to ecosystem. Other s prefer the term biological farming (farming in relation to\\nbiological diversity); yet others prefer the term bio-dynamic farming (biologically dynamic and\\necologically sound and sustainable farming) or macrobiotic agriculture (agriculture in relation to\\nmacro-fauna). Whatever be the name , the basic point is that organic farming is the farming based on\\nnatural principles, which alone are sustainable. According to Fantilanan (1990), organic farming is a\\nmatter of giving back to nature wh at we take from it.

So, one should know the relationships among soil, water, plants, and microflora and the\\noverall relationship between plants and animal kingdom, of which, man is the apex animal. It is the\\ntotality of these relationship, which is the backbone of organic farming.\\nOrganic farming does not totally exclude the elem ents of modern agriculture and varying agro\\nclimatic conditions do need input from the current technological advances. It is basically simple as it\\nabhors excessive ploughing, hoeing, weeding and application of plant protection chemicals and fertilizers.\\nThe principal elements to be considered w hile practising organic farming are:\\n\\x7f maintaining a living soil\\n\\x7f making available all the essential nutrients\\n\\x7f organic mulching for conservation, and\\n\\x7f attaining sustainable high yield\\nAgricultural practices followed in organic farming are governed by the principles of ecology and\\nare within the ecological means. Limited experience shows that this form of natural farming is the basis\\nfor sustainable agriculture and could be highly productive. It should not be discontinued for reversion\\nto inefficient and less productive farming systems.\\nHence, organic farming is a produc tion system, which avoids or largely excludes the use of syn-\\nthetic compound fertilizers, pesticides, growth regulators and livestock feed additives. To the maximum\\nextent feasible, it relies on crop r otation, crop residues, animal manures, legumes, green manures, off-\\nfarming organic wastes and aspect of biological pest control to maintain soil productivity and tilth, to\\nsupply plant nutrients and to control insects, weeds and other pests. In this system most of the ill effects\\nof modern day agriculture is avoided because:\\n\\x7f Use of agrochemical is forbidden.\\n\\x7f There is emphasis in building up of organic matter in the soil, thereby activate biological activity.\\n\\x7f Soil is treated as living organism.\\nEmphasis is given on\\n\\x7f Maintenance of favourable soil structure.\\n\\x7f Development and use of crop rotation that improves and prevents soil erosion.\\n\\x7f Biological control of pests, diseases and weeds.\\nE. Principles of organic agriculture systems\\nOrganic agriculture systems are based on three strongly interrelated principles under autonomous\\necosystem management: mixed farming, crop rotation and organic cycle optimization. The common\\nunderstanding of agriculture production in all types of organic agriculture is managing the production\\ncapacity of an agro-ecosystem. The process of extreme specialization propagated by the green revolution\\nled to the destruction of mixed and diversified farming and ecological buffer systems. The function of\\nthis autonomous ecosystem management is to meet the need for food and fibres on the local ecological\\ncarrying capacity.\\n(a) Mixed farming: In organic agriculture system, one strives for appropriate diversification,\\nwhich ideally means mixed farming, or the integration of crop and livestock production on the farm. In\\nthis way, cyclic processes and interactions in the agro-ecosystem can be optimised, like using crop\\nresidues in animal husbandry and manure for crop production. Diversification of species biotypes and\\nland use as a means to optimize the stability of the agro-ecosystem is another way to indicate the mixed\\nfarming concept. The synergistic concept among plants, animals, soil and biosphere support this idea.'),\n",

Besides, the classical rotation involving one crop per field per season, intercropping,\\nmixed cropping and under sowing are other options to optimize interactions. In addition to plant\\nfunctions, other important advantag es such as weed suppression,  reduction in soil-borne insect pests\\nand diseases, complimentary in nutrient demand, nutrient catching and soil covering can be mentioned.\\n(c) Organic cycle optimisation: Each field, farm, or region contains a given quantity of nutrients.\\nManagement should be used in such a way that optimal use is made of this finite amount. This means\\nthat nutrients should be recycled and used a number of times in different forms. Second, care should be\\ntaken that only a minimum amount of nutrients actually leave the system so that ‘import’ nutrients can\\nbe restricted. Third, the quantity of nutrients available to plants and animals can be increased within the\\nsystem by activating the edaphon, resulting in increased weathering of parent material.\\nF. Concept of organic farming\\nIt envisages a comprehensive management approach to improve the health underlying productivity of\\nthe soil. Organic farming is a matter of giving bac k to nature what we take from it. It is cheap,\\ninexpensive, profitable and sensible.\\nG. Components of organic farming\\nThey are ( i) organic manures, ( ii) non-chemical weed control measures, and ( iii) biological pest and\\ndisease management.\\n1. Organic manures: Organic materials such as farmyard manure, biogas, slurry, composts, straw\\nor other crop residues, biofertilisers, green manures and cover crop can substitute for inorganic\\nfertilisers to maintain the environmental quality. In addition, the organic farmers can also use\\nseaweeds and fish manures and some permitted fe rtilisers like basic-slag and rock phosphate.\\nThe use of organic manures will increase the organic matter content and water holding capacity\\nof the soil. Erosion is reduced by organic manures. Crop rotation with legumes adds to soil\\nfertility. Green manure provides the nutrients and improves the soil.\\n2. Non-chemical weed control measures: Compared to conventional farmers, the organic farmers\\nuse more of mechanical cultivation of row crops to reduce the weed menace. No herbicides are\\napplied as they lead to environmental pollution.\\n3. Biological pest management: The control of insect pests and pathogens is one of the most\\nchallenging jobs in tropical and sub-tropical agr iculture. Here again non-c hemical, biological\\npest management is encouraged. The conservation of natural enemies of pests is important for\\nminimising the use of chemical pesticides and for avoiding multiplication of insecticides-resistant\\npests. Botanical pesticides such as those derived from neem could be used. Selective microbial\\npesticides offer particular promise, of which strains of Bacillis thuringiensis is an example.\\nH. Essential characteristics of organic farming\\nThe most important characteristics are as follows:\\n\\x7f Maximal but sustainable use of local resources.\\n\\x7f Minimal use of purchased inputs, only as complementary to local resources.\\n\\x7f Ensuring the basic biological functions of soil-water-nutrients-humus.\\n\\x7f Maintaining a diversity of plant and animal species as a basis for ecological balance and eco-\\nnomic stability.\\n\\x7f Creating an attractive overall landscape , which gives satisfaction to the local people.'),\n",

Organic\\nagriculture systems include approaches and methods like organic, biodynamic, regenerative, nature farming\\nand permaculture. These were developed during the last 50 years. Although there are some differences\\namong these approaches, the common understanding is that practising organic agriculture is managing the\\nagro-ecosystem as an autonomous system, based on the primary production capacity of the soil under the\\ngiven agro-climatic conditions. Agro-ecosystem management implies treating the system, on any scale, as\\na living organism supporting its own vital potential for biomass and animal production, along with\\nbiological mechanisms for mineral balancing, soil improvement and pest control.\\nI. Possibility of organic farming in India\\nBy 2010 India needs 280 million tones of food grains and the nutrient requirement will be 34 million\\ntones of NPK. Estimate indicates that organic r esidues can provide 7.1, 3.0 and 7.6 million tones of\\nNPK respectively. Even if 50% of these organic residues are recycled, sustainable crop productivity can\\nbe achieved with less pollution and better quality food products.\\nJ. Advantages of organic farming\\n\\x7f Organic manures produce optimal conditions in the soil for high yields and good quality crops.\\n\\x7f They supply all the nutrients required by the plant (NPK, secondary and micronutrients).\\n\\x7f They improve plant growth and physiological activities of plants.\\n\\x7f They improve the soil physical properties such as granulation and good tilth, giving good aeration,\\neasy root penetration and improved water holding ca pacity. The fibrous portion of the organic\\nmatter with its high carbon content promotes soil aggregation to improve the permeability and\\naeration of clay soils while its ability to absorb moisture helps in the granulation of sandy soils\\nand improves their water holding capacity. The car bon in the organic matter is the source of\\nenergy for microbes, which help in aggregation.\\n\\x7f They improve the soil chemical properties suc h as supply and retention of soil nutrients and\\npromote favourable chemical reactions.\\n\\x7f They reduce the need for purchased inputs.\\n\\x7f Most of the organic manures are wastes or by-products, which on accumulation may lead to\\npollution. By way of utilizing them for organic farming, pollution is minimized.\\n\\x7f Organic fertilisers are considered as complete plant food. Organic matter restores the pH of the\\nsoil, which may become acid due to continuous application of chemical fertilisers.\\n\\x7f Organically grown crops are believed to pr ovide more healthy and nutritional superior food for\\nman and animals than those grown with commercial fertilisers.\\n\\x7f Organically grown plants are more resistant to pest and diseases, and hence few or two chemical\\nsprays or other protective treatments are required.\\n\\x7f There is an increasing consumer demand for agricultural produces, which are free of toxic\\nchemical residues. In developed countries consumers ar e willing to pay more organic foods.\\n\\x7f Organic farming helps to avoid chain reaction in the environment fr om chemical sprays and\\ndusts.\\n\\x7f Organic farming helps to prevent environmental degradation and can be used to regenerate\\ndegraded areas.'),\n",

In changing over to organic farming an initial crop loss generally occurs,\\nparticularly if it is rapid. Organic farmers may be afraid to enter the new market without adequate\\ngovernment support. Hence package of practices involving organic farming practices are to be spread\\namong the farmers and economics (cost-benefit ratio) be made available.\\nL. Options of organic farming\\nThere are at least three options availab le in organic far ming. They are:\\n1. Pure organic farming\\n2. Integrated green revolution farming\\n3. Integrated farming system (IFS)\\n1. Pure organic farming: Pure organic farming is done by the use of organic manures, biofertilizers\\nand bio-pesticides and completely avoiding inorganic fer tilizers and pesticides. This excludes\\nthe use of inorganics, both fertilisers and pesticides, but advocates the use of organic manures\\nand biological pest control methods. By the year 2000 A.D., to meet the demands of the popu-\\nlation of a billion people food production has to reach 230 million tonnes needing 24 million\\ntonnes of NPK fertilizers and 2 million tonnes of organics. If the entire NPK requirement is to\\nbe supplied in the form of organics, either as farm or town compost or green manure, the\\nquantity of organics required will be huge. But,  large potential of org anic resources remains\\nuntapped in the country. Nearly 750 million tonnes of cow dung, 250 million tonnes of buffalo\\nmanure and nearly 100–115 million tonnes of crop residues are available. The nutrient value of\\nthese organics produced annually is in the order of 2.5, 2.0 and 3 million tonnes of NPK\\nequivalent respectively. Besides, hundreds of millions tonnes of rural and urban compost could\\nbe collected.\\n2. Integrated green revolution farming: Integrated green revolution farming  is a high input\\ntechnology green revolution farming inv olving INM and IPM. Here chemical fertilizers and\\npesticides are used apart from or ganics, bio fertilizers and bio-control agents depending on the\\nnecessity. Under this option, the basic trends of the green revolution such as intensive use of\\nexternal inputs, increased irrigation, development of high yielding crop varieties and hybrids'),\n",

But much greater on the use of these inputs is obtained\\nas to limit damage to the environment and human health. For this purpose, some organic techniques\\nare developed and combined with the high input technology in order to create integrated systems\\nsuch as ‘Integrated nutrient management’ (INM), ‘Integrated pest management’ (IPM) and\\nbiological control methods which reduce the need for chemicals. Modern biotechnology is also\\nemployed to develop higher yielding, pest resistant crop varieties. This option is possible for\\nconditions, including fertile soils, climate and availability of necessary infrastructure facilities\\nlike irrigation.\\n3. Integrated farming system: The third option in organic farming is the low input organic farm-\\ning, in which the farmers have to depend on local resources and ecological processes, recycling\\nagricultural wastes and crop residues. Integrated Farming System (IFS) is a resource manage-\\nment strategy to achieve economic and sustained agricultural production through two or more\\ninterrelated or inter dependent agricultural and allied enterprises, to meet diverse requirements\\nof the farm household, while preserving the resources base (soil fertility) and maintaining a high\\nenvironmental quality. It is a Low Input Organic Farming (LIOF) in which the local resources\\nare effectively recycled. For example, Cropping (0.96 ha); Fishery (0.04 ha) + poultry in wetlands.\\nCrops, dairy, biogas, trees in garden lands. Crops, trees and goats in dry-farming areas.\\nCapital intensive green revolution techniques are simply not a feasible alternative for the poorest\\nof the 1.4 billion farmers who live on the tropical region with ecologically, geographically and\\ndevelopmentally less favourable production conditions. In order to cover such risks and to ensure\\nsustainability in their small holdings, the age-old mixed fa rming systems are prudently integrated with\\nthe cropping system.\\nM. Scope of bio-fertilizers in organic farming\\nIn the context of search for alternate sources for sustaining soil fertility through renewable sources,\\nharnessing of bacteria and other microorganisms for fixing N and efficient utilization of N assumes\\ngreater importance. An about 139 million tone of N per annum is fixed globally by microorganisms.\\nResearch shows that 25% of the N and P could be met through the bio-fertilizers for the cultivated crops\\nin our country. Efforts must be taken to cover the entire cropping area with bio fertilizers by alleviating\\nthe constraints in its production and commercializa tion. Thus bio-fertilizers can play a significant role\\nin the nutrient management of crops and in ushering organic farming in the near future.\\nN. Management of organic farming\\nManagement of organic farming system involves:\\n\\x7f Organization of crop and livestock production, and the management of farm resources in such\\na way that it harmonizes rather than conflicts with natural systems.\\n\\x7f Achievement of a closed cycle to the gr eatest extent possible between soil, plants, animals and\\npeople and an avoidance of environmental pollution.\\n\\x7f Maintenance of soil fertility for optimum production, relying primarily on renewable resources.\\n\\x7f Reduction of pest and disease incidence through a carefully designed farm rotation and enter-\\nprise structure; use of resistant varieties; the encouragement of beneficial pest predators; and the\\nuse of other biological pest control techniques.\\n\\x7f Use of forms of animal husbandry which respect the welfare and behavioural needs of farm\\nlivestock.'),\n",

One can assess sustainability or several indices\\n(Lal, 1994). Indices may be simple involving one parameter or complex involving several parameters.\\nAlthough general principles may be the same, there indices must be fine-tuned and adapted under local\\nenvironments. Some indices of sustainability include the following:\\n1. Productivity (P): Production per unit of resource used can be assessed by,\\nP = P/R; Where, P is productivity, P is total production and R is resource used.\\n2. Total Factor Productivity (TFP): It is defined as productivity per unit cost of all factors involved\\n(Herdt, 1993).\\n()0\\nTFP\\nn\\ni\\nP\\nRi Ci=\\n= ×∑\\nwhere, P is total production, R is resource used and C is cost of the resource, and n is the number\\nof resources used in achieving total production.\\n3. Coefficient of sustainability ( CS): It is measure of change in soil pr operties in r elation to\\nproduction under specific management system (Lal, 1991).\\nCs = F(Oi, Od, Om) t,\\nWhere, Cs is coefficient of sustainability, Oi is output per unit that maximizes per capita\\nproductivity or profit, Od is output per unit decline in the most limiting or non-renewable\\nresource, Om is the minimum assured output, and t is the time. The time scale is important and\\nmust be carefully selected.\\n4. Index of sustainability (Is): It is a measure of sustainability relating productivity to change in\\nsoil and environmental characteristics (Lal, 1993; Lal and Miller, 1993).\\nIs = f (Pi*Si*Wi*Ci)t,\\nWhere, Is index of sustainability, Si is alteration in soil properties, Wi is change in water resources\\nand quality, Ci is modification in climatic factor and t is time.'),\n",

It is\\nimportant to assess potential vis-à-vis actual productivity. In a science based management system,\\nactual production exceeds potential production in soils of low inherent fertility and in harsh environ-\\nments. The potential productivity, soils’ productive potential within a biome, can be estimated by\\nseveral models e.g., CERES (Richie et. al.,1989) and Tropical soil Productivity calculator (Aune and\\nLal, 1994). If land availability is a limiting factor, appropriate indices of productivity are Land use\\nFactor (L), Land Equivalent Ratio (LER), and Area Time Equivalent Ratio (ATER) etc.\\nSustainability coefficient (Sc): It is a complex and a multipurpose index based on a range of\\nparameters, and is similar to As.

Organic matter is the basis\\nof all bio-geo chemical cycles. The fundamental issues concerning efficient use of organic matter are\\nleakage of nutrients from agro ecosystems and the rates of decomposition. Organic matter and the\\nnutrients if contains are lost from soils by run off and mineralization (Tiuy, 1990), both of which can\\nbe controlled by appropriate tillage practices (Campbell et. al.,  1995); Lal et. al.,  1994). Loss of\\nnutrients to mineralization is also controlled by assuring sufficient inputs of plant or animal material to\\nmaintain the soil organic matter (SOM) reserves (Woodmansee, 1984). Legumes are important in\\nmaintaining SOM and increasing soil N suffer. In addition, they prefect the soil from run off water and\\nwind erosion and improve infiltration, agro forestry systems use leguminous and other trees to provide\\nalternative crops (Steppler and Lundgren 1988), produce ani mal forage and fuel, recycle nutrients for\\ncrop use and project soil from wind and water erosion (Altieri, 1987).\\nPlant biodiversity plays an important role in pest, disease, and weed management. Crop rotations\\nare effective in controlling pests, diseases and weeds (Altieri, 1987). Living mulches control weeds and\\nminimize the need for herbicides (Regnion and Jahnke, 1990); Increases in structural diversity within\\nthe crop canopy leads to greater diversity in insects and less damage from insect pests (Stinner and\\nBlair, 1990). Integration of animals into Agro ecosystems offers further diversity and stability. Mc-\\nInfire and Cryseels (1987) summarized the potential benefits of integration of crops and animals.\\nIntegration of animals facilitates nutrients movement and increases the opportunities for efficient nutrient\\nmanagement across the whole farm system. Animals increase overall net productivity of the farm and\\nreduce environmental degradation by serving as alternatives to crops on the marginal areas of farms by\\nutilizing crop residues as feed.\\n17.5.1 Optimizing Nutrient Availability\\nA very important condition for good plant growth and health and, indirectly, for good animal and\\nhuman health is the timely provision of sufficient and balanced quantities of nutrients that can be taken\\nup by the plant roots. Nutrient deficiencies and imbalances are main constraints to crop production,\\nespecially in regions with poor and very poor or alkaline soils. There is a constant flow of nutrients\\nthrough the farm. Some of the nutrients are lost by export of products, erosion, leaching and volatilization.\\nFor example, it has been estimated that in Africa nutrient losses through soil erosions and other processes\\nexceed application of artificial fertilizers (Stocking, 1986). If the farm is to remain productive it must\\nbe ensured that the amount of nutrients leaving the farm does not exceed the amount returned to it. In\\nother words, over time, there must be a positive nutrient balance.'),\n",

Also iron is a limiting factor in rice production in\\nthe new rice-wheat rotation evolved in the non-traditional rice growing areas of Punjab. One of the\\nsolutions to correct this micronutrient deficiencies is greater use of organic manures and multiple\\ncropping with legumes. At Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana field experimental results proved\\nthat application of poultry manure, pig manure and farmyard manure were effective in meeting zinc\\nrequirements in a maize-wheat rotation. Also cultural practices such as prolonged submergence of the\\nfield can be used to tackle iron and manganese deficiencies (Sharma, 1985).\\n17.5.3 Limiting Nutrient Losses\\nNutrient losses can be limited by:\\n\\x7f Recycling organic wastes by returning them to the field, either directly or treated (composted,\\nfermented etc.).\\n\\x7f Applying organic and artificial fertilizers in such a way that nutrients are not leached by exces-\\nsive rain or volatilized by high temperature or solar radiation.\\n\\x7f Reducing losses due to run-off and soil erosion.\\n\\x7f Minimizing nutrient losses due to biomass bussing.\\n\\x7f Reducing volatilization of nitrogen by denitrification under wet soil conditions.\\n\\x7f Avoiding leaching by using organic and artificial fertilizers, which release nutrients slowly,\\nmaintaining high humus content in the soil and intercropping plant species with different rooting\\ndepth.\\n\\x7f Limiting nutrient export in products by producing crops with relatively high economic value\\nrelative to nutrient content.\\n17.5.4 Use of Chemical Fertilizers\\nThe use of chemical fertilizers is essential for obtaining high crop yields. However, many small\\nlandholders and resource-poor farmers cannot offer co stly fertilizers. Most soils in the tropics are so\\ndeficient in primary nutrients that it is imperative that strategies be developed for adding them from\\noutside the ecosystem. There is some potential for enhancing N supply by biological N fixation. Addi-\\ntional N and other nutrients must be supplied. The requirements for chemical fertilizers, however, can\\nbe reduced considerably by decreasing losses, recycling nutrients and through biological N fixation.\\n17.5.5 Nutrient Recycling\\nNutrient recycling or regime is an important strategy for sustainable crop production. It involves return-\\ning nutrients removed by crops to the soil for further use. In addition, soil fauna ( e.g., earth worms,\\ntermites) also play an important role in recyc ling of plant nutrients. Growing deep-rooted crops is\\nimportant in order to recycle nutrients from the s ub soil by returning them through crop residue to the\\nsurface where the succeeding shallow rooted crops can use them. Use of mulches, incorporation of crop\\nresidues and animal waste, growing legumes as intercrops in cereals etc., can substantially reduce\\nchemical fertilizer requirements.\\n17.5.6 Use of Crop Residues\\nCrop residues contain substantial quantities of plant nutrients. The beneficial effects of returning crop'),\n",

It has a coastal line of 922 km and a land boundary of 1200 km. It lies\\nbetween 8o5' and 13o35' at N latitude and 76o15' and 80o20' of E longitude with an area of 1,30,069 sq.\\nkm. (50,154.7 sq. miles).\\nPHYSICAL FEATURES\\nThe State can be divided broadly into two natural divisions i.e., (a) the coastal plains, and ( b) the hilly\\nwestern areas. It can further be divided into coromandal plains comprising of the districts of\\nKancheepuram, Tiruvellore, Cuddalore, Villupuram, and Vellore, Thiruvannamalai and alluvial plains\\nof Cauvery delta e xtending over Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Thiruvarur and part of Trichy and dry\\nsouthern plains in Madurai, Ramanathapuram, Sivaganga, Virudunagar, Tuticorin and Tirunelveli dis-\\ntricts. It also extends a little in Western Ghats in Kanyakumari District. The Western Ghats averaging\\n3000' to 8000' height runs along the western part with the hill groups of Nilgiris and Anamalais on\\neither side of it. Palani hills, V arashanad and Andipatti ranges are the major off-shoots of Ghats. The\\nother prominent hills comprise of Javadis, Shervarayan, Kalvarayans and Pachai Malais. These ranges\\ncontinue south of river Cauvery. A plateau is found between these hills and the Western Ghats with an\\naverage elevation of 1000 feet raising west-ward.  The highest peak of Doddapettah in the Nilgiris is\\n8650' above M.S.L. Western Ghats forms a complete watershed and no river passes through them. The\\nmain streams i.e., Paraliyar, V attasery Phazhayar etc. are of limited length and fall in the Arabian sea.\\nAll other rivers are east-flowing rivers. The Eastern Ghats are not a complete watershed and as a result\\nthe rivers pass through them at places, notable among them is the river Cauvery. The main rivers of\\nTamil Nadu are Cauvery (with tributaries of Bhavani, Amaravathi, Noyyal) Vaigai, Tamaraparani, Palar,\\nPonniyar and Vellar.\\nCLIMATE\\nThe climate of Tamil Nadu is basically tropical. Due to its proximity to the sea, the summer is less hot\\nand winter is less cold. The maximum daily temperature rarely exceeds 43°C and the minimum daily\\ntemperature seldom falls below 18 oC. The State is exposed to both South-west and North-east\\nMonsoons.\\nAGRO-CLIMATIC ZONES\\nBased on rainfall distribution, irrigation pattern, soil characteristics, cropping pattern and other physical\\necological and social characteristics, Tamil Nadu State is classified into seven districts agro-climatic\\nzones delineated as follows:\\n(i) Northeastern Zone: This zone covers the districts of Kancheepuram, Tiruvellore, Vellore,\\nThiruvannamalai, Cuddalore (excluding Chidambaram and Kattumannarkovil taluks) and Ariyalur\\nand Perambalur taluks in Perambalur district.\\n(ii) Northwestern Zone: This zone comprises Dharmapuri district (Excluding hilly areas), Salem\\nand Namakkal districts (Excluding Tiruchengode taluk) and Perambalur taluk of Perambalur\\ndistrict.\\n(iii) Western Zone: Comprising Er ode and Coimbatore districts, Tiruchengode taluk of Namakkal,\\nKarur Taluk of Karur district and nort hern parts of Madurai district.\"),\n",

For a more complete\\nglossary and acronyms, we recommend the readers to refer the books like Agriculture : Facts and\\nFigures (Subbaian, Annadurai and Palaniappan, 2000–published by Scientific Publishers, Jodhpur,\\nIndia), Agronomic terminology (by Indian Society of Agronomy, New Delhi) and Glossary of terms in\\ncrop production (by Ramamoorthy, Annadurai and Subbaian, 2005 published by Scientific Publishers,\\nJodhpur, India, 420p). For few important words, the glossary of terms is given then and there.\\nAbsolute humidity: The actual mass of water vapour present in a given volume of moist air. It is\\nexpressed as grams of water vapour per cubic meter or cubic feet.\\nAbsolute water requirement: Also called consumptive use of water. This is the quantity of water\\nin ha-cm per crop season absorbed by the crop together with the evaporation from the crop producing\\nland. It includes the water used by evapo-tr anspiration and retained in the plant body.\\nAbsorption: The process by which a substance is taken into and included within another sub-\\nstance, i.e., intake of water by soil, or intake of gases,  water, nutrients, or other substances by plants.\\nAbsorptivity: Absorptivity of a substance is defined as the ratio of the amount of radiant energy\\nabsorbed to the total amount incident upon that substance. The absorptivity of a blackbody is unity.\\nNatural bodies like sun and earth are near perfect black bodies\\nAcre-Foot: A volume of water required to irrigate an area of one acre to a depth of one foot. This\\nis equal to 43,560 c. ft or 1233.5 m 3.\\nAcre-Inch: A volume of water necessary to cover an area of one acre of land to a depth of one inch.\\nThe volume of this water is 3630 cubic feet (102.8 m 3). 1 cubic feet = 0.0283 m 3 = 28.32 litres.\\nActual crop evapo-transpiration: Rate of evapo-transpiration equal to or smaller that PET as\\naffected by the level of available soil water salinity field, size, or other causes; mm/day.\\nActual vapour pressure: Pressure exerted by water vapour contained in the air, millibar (mb) or\\nmm of Hg.\\nAdsorption: The increased concentration of molecules or ions at a surface, including exchangeable\\ncations and anions on soil particles.\\nAdvection: The process of transport of an atmospheric property (such as heat, water vapour or\\nmomentum) solely by the horizontal motions of the atmosphere.\\nAerodynamic: Refers to forces of moving air acting upon the soil of crop surface.\\nAggregate: A single mass or cluster of soil consisting of many soil particles held together, such as\\na clod, prism, crumb, or granule.'),\n",

They make a living mainly or wholly by selling their labour in agriculture\\nof allied activities as free or attached or share-cropper for a very low wage in without much security of\\ntenure.\\nAgro climatic regions: The grouping of different physical areas within the country into broadly\\nhomogeneous zones based on climatic and edaphic factors.\\nAir capacity: The quantity of air in the soil when the soil is at field moisture capacity.\\nAlbedo: It is the capacity of any surface to re flect the incoming radiation (light) or it is the ratio\\nof incoming radiation to the outgoing radiation. The total reflectivity is known as earth’s albedo.\\nAverage albedo value for earth is 34%. The total energy coming to the earth over a considerable period\\nof time is equal to the total outward losses. If this were not so, the earth would seen become either very\\nhot or very cold. Actually there is a deficit of heat at higher latitudes and surplus in low latitudes.\\nAlkali soil: A soil that contains sufficient exchangeable sodium to interfere with the growth of most\\ncrop plants, either with or without appreciable quantities of soluble salts.\\nAlkaline soil: A soil that has an alkaline reaction,  i.e ., a soil for which the pH reading of the\\nsaturated soil paste is higher than 7.\\nAnticyclone: When isobars are circular, elliptical in shape and the pressure is highest at the centre\\nsuch a pressure system is called ‘High’ or ‘Anticyclone’. When the isobars are elliptical rather than\\ncircular the system is called as ‘Ridge’ or ‘Wedge’. The movement will be clockwise in the Northern\\nhemisphere while it is anti-clockwise in the southern hemisphere.\\nAquifer: Water bearing formation in the ground that will yield enough water.\\nArid: A climate that is characterized by low rainfall and high rate of evaporation. Arid climate is\\nusually defined as less than 10 inches (25 cm ) of precipitation per year , and semi-arid as between 10\\nand 20 inches per year.\\nAtmospheric pressure: The pressure exerted by the atmosphere as a consequence of the weight of\\nthe air lying directly above the unit of area in question. At sea level atmospheric pressure is equal to\\n76 cm Hg column.\\nAvailable soil water: Depth of water stored in the root zone between field capacity and PWP;\\nmm/m soil depth.\\nBlackbody radiation: A Blackbody is defined as a body,  which completely absorbs all the heat\\nradiations falling on it without reflecting and transmitting any of it. It means reflectivity and transmittivity\\nbecome zero. When such a black body is he ated, it emits radiation of all wavelengths depending upon\\nits temp.\\nBlue colour of the sky: If the circumference of the scattering particle is less than about 1/10 of the\\nwavelength of the incident radiation, the scattering co-efficient is inversely proportional to the fourth\\npower of the wavelength of the incident radiation. This is known as Rayleigh scattering. This is the\\nprimary cause of the blue colour of the sky. For larger particles with circumference >30 times of\\nwavelength of the incident radiation, scattering is independent of the wavelength ( i.e.,) white light is\\nscattered. This is known as Mei scaring.\\nBowen ratio: The ratio of energy fluxes upward as sensible heat to latent energy flux in the same\\ndirection (negative when the fluxes are in opposite directions).\\nBuoyancy: The upward force exerted on a volume of fluid (or an object in the fluid) by virtue of\\ndensity difference between the volume of fluid (or the object) and that of the surrounding fluid.\\nCalorie (cal): A unit of heats required raising the temperature of 1 g of water from 14.5–15.5°C.\\nThe international table calorie equals 1.00032 cal.'),\n",

Water ‘hangs’  around the perimeter of the tube by virtue of\\nadsorption forces between the tube surface and the liquid and the cohesive forces in the liquid surface\\nor surface tension. Capillary rise (h) can be given as:\\n()22 c o sorhh rg rg\\nσσ α== ρρ\\nwhere σ is the surface tension, r is the radius of the capillary tube, ρ is the density of the liquid and ;\\nαg is the contact angle between water and soil pore (assumed to be zero).\\nCell water potential: Water potential is a measure of the free energy status of water. As applied to\\nplant cells, under isothermal equilibrium conditions, the various factors involved in cell water relations\\ncan be summarized by the following equation.\\nΨcell = ΨS + ΨD + ΨM\\nin which Ψcell is the potential of water in the cell and the other terms express the contribution to Ψcell\\nby solutes ΨS pressure ΨD and matric forces ( ΨM). ΨS and ΨM are both negative while ΨP is positive.\\nΨS expresses the effect of solutes in the cell solution, and ΨM expresses the effect of water-binding\\ncolloids and surfaces in the cell. The sum of ΨS+ΨP+ΨM is a negative number , except in fully turgid\\ncells when it becomes zero. In this case, the positive pressure potential ΨP balances the sum of the\\nnegative osmotic and matric potentials. It may be shown that DPD is numerically equal to Ψcell but\\nopposite in sign (Kr amer, 1969), that is,\\nΨCell = DPD\\nThe potential of water in a cell is less than that of pure water, i.e., it is negative whereas, DPD is\\npositive because it is defined as a deficit.\\nChemical potential of water: The chemical potential of a substance in a system is a measure of\\nthe capacity of that substance to work.

Conduction occurs through molecular movement.\\nConvection: Convection is the process of the transfer of heat, through movement of a mass or\\nsubstance from one place to another. Convention is possible only in gases or fluids, for they alone have\\ninternal mass motions. In solid substances this type of heat transfer is impossible.\\nCubic foot per second (cu sec): A continuous flow of water equal to a stream of one foot wide, one\\nfoot deep, and flowing at a velocity of one foot/second.
